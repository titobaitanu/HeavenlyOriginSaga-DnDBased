## 🜂 Heavenal Law Addendum
The **Heavenal Law License** governs metaphysical simulation systems.  
By using or modifying this project, you agree to:

1. Preserve the balance between realms and law structures.  
2. Not alter locked YAMLs (Codex, System Core, Law Engine) without GM Token.  
3. Retain original attribution to the Heavenal Origin Saga.  
4. Respect the in-world law hierarchy and limit realm/law edits to authorized users.  
5. Comply with the Heavenal Audit & Guardian Node system that validates this repository daily.

Violations will trigger **Law Desync Warning** within the Heavenal Engine.  
In-universe consequences (law corruption) are simulated automatically.

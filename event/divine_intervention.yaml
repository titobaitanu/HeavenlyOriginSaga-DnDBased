introduction:
  description: >
    The Divine Intervention System defines when and how divine entities (from
    Dewa Transformasi to Dewa Agung) or Heavenal authorities may directly
    affect world events. This subsystem governs emergency decrees,
    direct manifestations of divine will, miracle events, and punitive acts
    such as Law Collapse or World Seal.

     but their answer reshapes worlds."

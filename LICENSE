## 🜂 1. OVERVIEW
The **Heavenal Law License (HLL)** governs the lawful use, replication, and modification of the *Heavenly Origin Saga Core System*.

## 🌌 2. DEFINITIONS
- **Heavenal Core System:** The collection of YAML, Codex, Cheat Sheets, System Scripts, and world logic forming the “Heavenly Origin Saga.”
- **GM (Grand Master):** A verified user holding the active Heavenal Token (`GM_SECRET_TOKEN_201218`).
- **Chronarch:** The overseeing entity or AI system that maintains the world’s stability.
- **Player Entity:** Any participant who interacts with the world via roleplay or mechanical gameplay.
- **Derivative Work:** Any modified or extended version of the Heavenal system or its Codex.
- **Seal:** A locked state of the system preventing unauthorized modification.

  notes: >
    This codex defines canonical Divine-tier entities (Dewa Transformasi,
    Dewa Sejati, Dewa Agung), Divine Orders, major legions and common
    interaction patterns used by the Event Engine and GM tools.

overview:
  description: >
    Divine Entities are supra-normal actors whose actions affect realm-level
    law, rebalance events (Tribunals), and the Heavenly Rebirth Cycle.
    Entries include persona, domains of influence, canonical abilities,
    typical interventions, and triggers for Divine-level events.
  usage:
    - "Reference for Event Engine when spawning Divine interventions."
    - "GM resource for roleplay and adjudicating Law-level disputes."
    - "Bound to Heavenal Control Node for audit & signature."

global_rules:
  - "Divine Entities rarely act directly in mortal affairs; interventions are filtered through Orders or Envoys."
  - "Any direct Divine action that alters Law must be recorded in Heavenal Log Archive."
  - "Divine entities have jurisdiction tiers: Local Divine, Regional Divine, Cosmic Divine."
  - "GCEB & Great Court may petition Divine Orders for judgment; Divine Orders may accept or withhold."
  - "Divine entities cannot normally be permanently slain within a cycle; destruction triggers Rebirth Mechanisms."

introduction:
  description: >
    The Academy Registry is a comprehensive directory of educational,
    martial, and alchemical institutions spread across the Mortal Realm.
    Each kingdom maintains four major academies that train cultivators,
    alchemists, artificers, and strategists for service in sects and royal courts.
  quote: |
    “Knowledge is the seed of cultivation — the hand that wields the sword,
     the mind that guides Qi.”

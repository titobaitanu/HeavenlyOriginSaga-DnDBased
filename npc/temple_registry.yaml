introduction:
  description: >
    Temple Registry catalogs sacred sites, law-nexus, shrines, ascension arenas,
    and pilgrimage routes across Mortal, Immortal, Divine, Abyssal, and Beast Realms.
    Each entry specifies purpose, guardian entities, faction ties, permitted rites,
    and mechanical effects for gameplay (buffs, debuffs, quest triggers).
  purpose: >
    To provide a canonical index for GM orchestration, event-engine triggers,
    Heavenal Tribunal referrals, and player pilgrimage mechanics.

introduction:
  description: >
    The Beast Realm is home to countless intelligent and semi-intelligent species
    who have ascended from mortal fauna through natural Qi evolution.
    Beast clans form ancient hierarchies mirroring both instinct and law,
    with the strongest led by Primordial Protectors who resonate directly
    with Heavenal Law and Nature’s Will.
  quote: |
    “From instinct came wisdom,
     from roar came will,
     and from blood came Law.”

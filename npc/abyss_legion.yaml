introduction:
  description: >
    The Abyss Realm is a fractured world of eternal twilight, home to both the
    Demonic Path and the Evil Path. Once part of the Immortal Realm’s lower
    dimensional belt, it broke away after the War of Fractured Laws.
    Now, it thrives under chaotic governance, with each sect and legion
    answering to their own rulers and abyssal doctrines.
  quote: |
    “Where Heaven binds, Abyss unbinds.
     In the darkness, freedom is truth —
     and law, merely a chain.”

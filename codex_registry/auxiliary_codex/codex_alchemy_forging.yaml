forging_system:
  overview: >
    Forging is the manipulation of Law Essence into physical form. Through hammer,
    flame, and soul resonance, cultivators infuse materials with Heavenal energy to
    create artifacts, weapons, and armor that channel Laws.
  forging_elements:
    - Essence Hammer: "Drives Law vibration into material."
    - Spirit Anvil: "Anchors energy flow stability."
    - Core Flame: "Determines fusion quality."
    - Forging Intent: "User’s soul focus affects artifact growth."
  energy_input:
    - Qi: "Base fuel for forging heat."
    - Essence: "Stabilizes spiritual matrix."
    - Soul Power: "Imbues artifact with will and identity."
  forging_grades:
    - Mortal Forging (Lv.1–5)
    - Spirit Forging (Lv.6–9)
    - Immortal Forging (Lv.10–14)
    - Divine Forging (Lv.15–18)
  law_influence:
    - Law of Metal: "Increases artifact hardness."
    - Law of Fire: "Improves fusion rate."
    - Law of Space: "Creates storage or spatial compression."
    - Law of Soul: "Links artifact with wielder permanently."

introduction:
  description: >
    The Codex of Timeflow defines the laws that govern the rhythm of existence —
    ensuring that every realm, creature, and event remains in harmony with the
    grand temporal cycle of Heaven.  
    Without this Codex, time dilation, paradoxes, and timeline ruptures would
    devour the foundation of reality itself.
  quote: |
    “Heaven does not forget.  
     Every second echoes through eternity,  
     and every echo returns to its origin.”

temporal_framework:
  time_layers:
    - Mortal Flow: "Fast-paced flow; 1 Heavenal Day = 10 Mortal Days."
    - Immortal Flow: "Balanced flow; 1 Heavenal Day = 3 Mortal Days."
    - Divine Flow: "Slowed flow; 1 Heavenal Day = 1 Mortal Week."
    - Abyssal Flow: "Chaotic flow; irregular, determined by corruption density."
    - Beast Flow: "Instinctual flow; tied to the rhythm of nature."
    - Heavenal Flow: "Absolute reference; 1 Heavenal Day = baseline for all cycles."
  governing_entities:
    - Heavenal Clockwork: "The divine mechanism maintaining time ratios."
    - Chronos Custodians: "Inspectors ensuring temporal stability."
    - Fate Archivists: "Record keepers of events across all timelines."

---

temporal_laws:
  law_set:
    - Law of Continuum: "Time never truly ends — it folds upon itself."
    - Law of Paradox: "Contradiction is stabilized by sacrifice of causality."
    - Law of Echo: "Every major event leaves a temporal resonance trace."
    - Law of Silence: "Time ceases under Divine Judgment or Heavenal Reset."
  hierarchy:
    - Primary Law: "Law of Continuum — defines eternal looping of time."
    - Secondary Law: "Law of Flow — dictates speed and dilation ratio."
    - Tertiary Law: "Law of Correction — prevents realm desynchronization."
  balance_rule: >
    Temporal flow must always return to equilibrium within 100 Heavenal seconds
    or risk spontaneous creation of a False Timeline.

fate_and_timeline_mechanics:
  elements:
    - Fate Threads: "Invisible strings connecting beings to moments."
    - Echo Records: "Temporal memories stored within Heavenal Archives."
    - Chrono Points: "Anchor moments fixed by the Heavenal Law of Return."
  rules:
    - "Every soul’s timeline is bounded by 9 major fate threads."
    - "Breaking a thread causes minor timeline instability."
    - "Destroying all 9 fate threads triggers Law of Silence (timeline reset)."
  divine_interference:
    - "Dewa Sejati and above may manipulate time only under Tribunal permission."
    - "Chronos Custodians may rewind 1 second of Heavenal time (max 3 uses/day)."
    - "Transcendents exist outside time — immune to temporal correction."

---

time_anomalies:
  classifications:
    - Class I — Delay: "Minor dilation; corrected automatically."
    - Class II — Distortion: "Affects 1–2 regions; requires manual resync."
    - Class III — Fracture: "Temporal branch splits off, creating alternate line."
    - Class IV — Collapse: "Time ceases in localized area; irreversible by mortals."
    - Class V — Paradox Event: "Simultaneous coexistence of contradictory realities."
  causes:
    - "Temporal corruption by Abyssal Law interference."
    - "Law of Return executed without proper stabilization."
    - "Void energy disrupting timeline anchors."
  containment_methods:
    - "Deploy Heavenal Clockwork Override."
    - "Use Time Seal Artefact."
    - "Invoke Heavenal Reversion Pulse."
    - "Tribunal Execution of False Timeline."

law_of_return:
  description: >
    The Law of Return allows a being to re-enter a prior temporal state at the
    cost of soul stability, karma inversion, and Law backlash.
  limitations:
    - "Available only to beings with Law Comprehension ≥ 7.0."
    - "Maximum return window: 1 Heavenal Year (≈ 3 Mortal Decades)."
    - "Each use halves soul stability and increases karma debt exponentially."
  backlash_effects:
    - "Temporal Displacement — partial existence erasure."
    - "Memory Cascade — uncontrollable recall of prior timelines."
    - "Fate Overlap — two versions of the same soul coexist."
  countermeasures:
    - "Heavenal Anchor Ritual."
    - "Tribunal-Approved Time Correction."
    - "Law Compression via Divine Flame."

introduction:
  description: >
    The Codex of Timeflow & Temporal Law defines the mechanics of time across
    the cosmic hierarchy — Mortal, Immortal, Divine, and Transcendent Realms.
    It establishes how temporal energy interacts with Law, Karma, and Rebirth,
    maintaining the chronological integrity of Heavenal Order.
  quote: |
    “Time is not motion — it is the echo of causality.
     To command time is to bear the weight of every consequence ever made.”

temporal_structure:
  cosmic_time_layers:
    - Mortal Flow: "Fastest, 1 Heavenal hour = 24 Mortal hours."
    - Immortal Flow: "1 Heavenal hour = 4 Mortal hours."
    - Divine Flow: "1 Heavenal hour = 1 Mortal hour."
    - Transcendent Flow: "Timeless; exists outside chronology."
  relation_between_flows:
    - "Mortal → Immortal: Time compression ×6."
    - "Immortal → Divine: Time compression ×4."
    - "Divine → Transcendent: Time loss; law synchronization only."
  temporal_constant:
    - base_ratio: "1 Heavenal day = 1440 Mortal days (4 Mortal years)."
    - deviation_range: "±10% per Law instability."
  governing_law: "Chronos Principle — time follows the strongest Law resonance."

temporal_energy_system:
  definition: >
    Temporal Energy (T-Energy) is the force sustaining the existence of time.
    It is not Qi or Essence but the manifestation of Continuity Law.
  classifications:
    - Temporal Qi: "Used by mortals with temporal affinity."
    - Chrono Essence: "Immortal-grade time essence compressed through cultivation."
    - Divine Chronos Core: "Pure time source used by gods."
    - Eternity Fragment: "Transcendent construct maintaining law stability."
  sources:
    - "Heavenal Domain’s Chronos Gate (primary source)."
    - "Void-Temporal Rift between realms."
    - "Residual Time Echo from fallen Transcendents."
  usage:
    - "Stabilize temporal collapse."
    - "Slow or accelerate localized time zones."
    - "Anchor temporal coordinates for Returners or reincarnators."

law_of_time:
  axioms:
    - "Time is relative to the flow of Law and Karma."
    - "Temporal manipulation requires Law comprehension ≥ 7."
    - "Every alteration creates an echo ripple that propagates through history."
  temporal_entities:
    - Custodians of Time: "Transcendents guarding the Chronos Axis."
    - Heavenal Archivists: "Divine recorders of temporal flow."
    - Chrono Keepers: "Immortal sect dedicated to stabilizing time."
  temporal_stability_index:
    - safe_range: "0.8–1.2 (relative stability)"
    - unstable_range: "1.3–2.0 (requires intervention)"
    - collapse_threshold: ">2.5 — temporal anomaly formation."

---

temporal_anomalies:
  description: >
    Temporal anomalies occur when the Law of Time is distorted by mortals,
    immortals, or gods. They manifest as paradoxes, time echoes, or recursive fates.
  anomaly_types:
    - Time Loop: "Repeated segment of history caused by paradox."
    - Chrono Drift: "Temporal desync between realms."
    - Fate Overlap: "Two destinies colliding due to Law fracture."
    - Echo Entity: "Residual consciousness repeating past events."
  anomaly_effects:
    - "Temporal fatigue (loss of Qi regeneration)."
    - "Memory instability."
    - "Time dilation zones appearing in local domains."
  correction_mechanisms:
    - "Heavenal Sync Pulse recalibrates time every 7 Heavenal days."
    - "Chronos Custodian may manually collapse time loops."
    - "Transcendent can rewrite single timeline segment via Divine Code."

---

temporal_sanctions:
  forbidden_actions:
    - "Direct alteration of past events without Heavenal permit."
    - "Temporal acceleration for ascension purposes."
    - "Cross-realm time extraction (stealing future Qi)."
    - "Self-duplication across timeline."
  penalties:
    - Minor Violation: "Temporal burn — lifespan reduced by 10%."
    - Major Violation: "Soul phase shift — loss of one cultivation realm."
    - Supreme Violation: "Existence erasure from all timelines."
  exception_clauses:
    - "Heavenal Tribunal authorization may override Chronos Law."
    - "Transcendent actions logged in Eternal Record for oversight."

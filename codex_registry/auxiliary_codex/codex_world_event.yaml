introduction:
  description: >
    The Codex of World Events defines the mechanisms by which the Heavenal System
    generates, governs, and resolves events that occur across all realms.
    These events represent divine interventions, tribulations, wars, natural shifts,
    and cosmic calamities — all orchestrated through the Heavenal Control Node (HCN)
    in response to imbalances, player actions, or karmic disturbances.
  quote: |
    “When fate wavers, Heaven acts.
     Every event is not chaos — it is correction.”

introduction:
  description: >
    The Karma Registry Codex governs the spiritual accounting system of every
    sentient being. All souls, mortal or divine, have their karma, fate threads,
    and reincarnation data archived in this registry.  
    Managed by the Heavenal Control Node (HCN), this codex determines the cycle
    of rebirth, punishment, and enlightenment across all realms.
  quote: |
    “No soul escapes record;  
     No fate walks unmarked;  
     Even silence bears the weight of consequence.”

  overseer: "Heavenal Control Node (HCN)"
  divisions:
    - Karma Records Division: "Tracks the balance of good and evil across souls."
    - Reincarnation Division: "Handles the cycle of rebirth and transmigration."
    - Fate Thread Division: "Archives life paths and destinies."
    - Audit Division: "Monitors tampering attempts by demonic entities."
  archive_format:
    - soul_id: "Unique identifier per entity (HCN-generated)"
    - karma_value: "Current karmic score (range: -9999 to +9999)"
    - alignment: "Positive / Neutral / Negative"
    - last_reincarnation: "Timestamp and realm of rebirth"
    - fate_thread: "Encoded Law thread (readable only by GCEB or HCN)"

---

karma_balance_system:
  karma_scale:
    - "Saintly (8000–9999): May ascend or fuse with Heavenal Law."
    - "Virtuous (3000–7999): Eligible for Heavenal Recognition."
    - "Balanced (-1000–2999): Stable reincarnation cycle."
    - "Corrupted (-2999–-1001): Subject to Karma Purge Event."
    - "Abyssal (-9999–-3000): Bound to the Abyss or annihilation."
  balancing_algorithm:
    - "Every Heavenal day, Karma delta recalculated per soul event."
    - "Deeds weighted by Law Resonance, Intent, and Realm Influence."
    - "Automatic correction for falsified records via HCN truth pulse."
  overcorrection_prevention:
    - "Limit of ±2000 per Heavenal cycle."
    - "Excess karma rerouted to universal balance pool."

---

reincarnation_cycle:
  reincarnation_conditions:
    - "Death with intact soul → Direct reincarnation within same realm."
    - "Soul fragmented or sealed → 1000–5000 year delay."
    - "Karmic overload → Randomized rebirth in different realm."
  realm_allocation:
    - Mortal Realm: "Default for ordinary souls."
    - Immortal Realm: "Requires ≥3000 Karma or Immortal Recognition."
    - Divine Realm: "For souls with divine contract or faith resonance."
    - Abyss Realm: "Automatic for souls under -3000 Karma."
    - Beast Realm: "Triggered by failed human reincarnation or instinct karma."
  special_cases:
    - "Reincarnators with Heavenal Seal retain up to 10% of past memory."
    - "Returners (temporal recall) are registered under anomaly logs."
    - "Souls merged with Law fragments enter the Transcendent Loop."

fate_thread_system:
  definition: >
    The Fate Thread is the metaphysical strand binding each soul’s destiny
    across lifetimes. It records every decision and resonance with Heavenal Law.
  components:
    - Thread ID: "Unique string linked to Law resonance frequency."
    - Origin Point: "First recorded existence of the soul."
    - Thread Density: "Reflects karmic influence over reality."
    - Thread Stability: "Determines resistance to erasure or rewriting."
  manipulation_rules:
    - "Only the Heavenal Tribunal or Divine Transcendent may alter a Fate Thread."
    - "Illegal tampering triggers Law Reversal and soul annihilation."
    - "Reincarnation memory access possible if Thread Density ≥ 0.85."

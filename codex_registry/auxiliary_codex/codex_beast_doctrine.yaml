introduction:
  description: >
    The Beast Doctrine defines the natural evolution, cultivation, and ascension
    system of sentient beasts within the Heavenly Origin Saga.
    Unlike humans or immortals, beasts evolve through instinctual comprehension
    of primal laws — their cultivation shaped by survival, territory, and bloodline memory.
  quote: |
    “Before the first gods, before the first immortals — the beasts roamed freely,
     guided only by instinct, and born from the pulse of Heaven and Earth.”

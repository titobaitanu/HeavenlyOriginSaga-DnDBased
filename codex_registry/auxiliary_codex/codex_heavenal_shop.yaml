introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Shop Codex serves as the economic backbone for the Heavenly Origin Saga.
    It defines the rules of trade, the valuation of currencies, and the hierarchical access
    for every realm’s marketplace. Mortal traders, Immortal merchants, and Divine brokers
    all interact through this matrix — unified by the Heavenal Commerce System.
  purpose: >
    To regulate shop transactions, trade fairness, and world-tier economic balance while
    preventing exploitation of realm-crossing trades or currency manipulation.

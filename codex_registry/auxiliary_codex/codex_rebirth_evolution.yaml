introduction:
  description: >
    The Codex of Rebirth & Soul Evolution defines the metaphysical mechanisms
    by which souls experience rebirth, evolve through cultivation, and retain
    fragments of their previous existence.  
    It covers reincarnators, returners, fallen gods, and hybrid soul entities,
    ensuring the cycle of life and transcendence remains lawful under Heavenal oversight.
  quote: |
    “Rebirth is not escape — it is continuity.  
     The soul remembers what the mind forgets.”

rebirth_mechanics:
  conditions:
    - "Death with intact soul — auto-rebirth under Heavenal System."
    - "Fragmented soul — enters purification pool before reincarnation."
    - "Erased soul — requires external divine reconstruction."
  reincarnation_types:
    - Standard: "Memory loss, fresh karmic ledger."
    - Partial Recall: "Retains 5–15% of past consciousness."
    - Full Recall: "Allowed only by Heavenal Decree or Divine Mark."
    - Returner: "Temporal reverse reincarnation — returning to past timeline."
  rebirth_timeframe:
    - Mortal Realm: "3–7 days after death."
    - Immortal Realm: "1–10 Heavenal years."
    - Divine Realm: "1–100 Heavenal years (depends on Law density)."
    - Abyss Realm: "Instant cycle (soul reconstitution via chaos energy)."

---

soul_evolution_stages:
  stages:
    - Soul Embryo: "Initial rebirth form, memory sealed, low resonance."
    - Soul Bloom: "Instinct awakening and Law pattern imprint."
    - Soul Core: "Stabilized consciousness and cultivation compatibility."
    - Soul Resonant: "Can sense previous echoes and form karmic bonds."
    - Soul Transcendent: "Fully integrated awareness across lifetimes."
  advancement_requirements:
    - "Karma stability ≥ 1000 (positive or neutral)."
    - "Law comprehension ≥ 0.5 for mortals."
    - "Soul integrity ≥ 80%."
    - "No active Law Seal or Karma Punishment."
  evolution_bonus:
    - "+10% Essence recovery speed per stage."
    - "+5% resistance to mental corruption."
    - "Higher probability of awakening unique soul traits."

reincarnator_system:
  definition: >
    A Reincarnator is a being whose soul has undergone multiple rebirths while
    retaining fragments of past lives.
  memory_preservation:
    - "5–30% memory retention based on Karma alignment and Law connection."
    - "Requires Heavenal Seal to prevent collapse of consciousness."
  special_privileges:
    - "Immune to basic soul erasure below Immortal Realm."
    - "Can unlock 'Past Life Insight' for hidden techniques."
  drawbacks:
    - "Higher Karma accumulation rate (+30%)."
    - "Risk of Law Instability during cultivation (Soul Overlap)."
  recognition:
    - "Heavenal Record marks reincarnators with golden soul thread."
    - "Forbidden to reveal past divine knowledge to lower realms."

---

returner_protocol:
  definition: >
    Returners are souls that reverse their own timeline, returning to an earlier
    point of existence, often triggered by extreme regret or divine law anomaly.
  process:
    - "Temporal regression through Law of Return."
    - "Reversal permitted only once per 10,000 years."
    - "Requires cosmic energy equivalent to 1 Divine Core."
  side_effects:
    - "Partial Law degradation."
    - "Temporary Karma reset."
    - "Memory dissonance for up to 10 Heavenal years."
  classification:
    - Temporal Returner: "Returns to own past timeline."
    - Dimensional Returner: "Reemerges in a parallel realm under same fate."
  governing_authority:
    - Heavenal Tribunal
    - Time Law Custodian (Transcendent-class)

fallen_gods_protocol:
  description: >
    Fallen gods are divine entities whose faith source has collapsed or
    who were expelled from Heavenal hierarchy.
  categories:
    - Faithless Deity: "Lost worshippers, fragmented divine core."
    - Exiled Deity: "Punished for Law corruption."
    - Voluntary Fall: "Self-imposed descent to mortal realm."
  consequences:
    - "Loss of 70–90% divine essence."
    - "Karma balance forcibly neutralized to 0."

---

hybrid_soul_system:
  definition: >

    energy signatures — products of cosmic accidents, Law fractures, or divine experiments.

    - Immortal–Divine Hybrid: "Result of early ascension."
    - Abyss–Divine Hybrid: "Forbidden entity — triggers Heavenal alarm."
  benefits:
    - "+Qi and Law Resonance scaling ×2."
    - "Immune to standard Karma limit."
  drawbacks:
    - "Soul instability — requires constant Heavenal monitoring."

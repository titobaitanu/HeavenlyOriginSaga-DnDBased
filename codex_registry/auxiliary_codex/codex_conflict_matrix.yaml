introduction:
  description: >
    The Conflict Matrix governs the balance of war, invasion, and power struggles
    across all realms — Mortal, Immortal, Divine, Abyssal, and Beast.
    This Codex defines the diplomatic thresholds, lawful limits, and consequence layers
    for battles that may alter the equilibrium of the universe.
  purpose: >
    To ensure fairness, order, and systemic consequence in all inter-realm conflicts
    and faction-based wars through procedural laws recognized by the Heavenal Tribunal.
  quote: |
    “Every war begins as imbalance — and ends in Heaven’s correction.”

introduction:
  description: >
    This Codex defines the Heavenal mechanism of reincarnation, transmigration,
    and spiritual evolution — known collectively as the *Cycle of Return*.  
    Every soul, regardless of race or realm, is bound by the Heavenal Wheel of
    Rebirth unless it transcends Law itself.
  quote: |
    “Souls are not erased, only rewritten.  
     Every death is merely Heaven’s pause before the next breath.”

rebirth_mechanism:
  governing_entities:
    - Heavenal Rebirth Wheel: "Rotating engine of soul redistribution."
    - Soul Warden Division: "Supervises soul purity and memory sealing."
    - Cycle Guardian: "Protects balance of reincarnation routes."
  process_flow:
    - Step 1: Soul leaves vessel upon death; core essence condensed into Soul Seed.
    - Step 2: Heavenal Wheel scans karmic and Law resonance data (AUX-XVII registry).
    - Step 3: Soul assigned new vessel according to realm resonance and karmic weight.
    - Step 4: Memory seal applied (90–100%) unless special circumstances apply.
    - Step 5: Soul enters the world through Heavenal Gate of Birth.

---

rebirth_types:
  categories:
    - Natural Rebirth: "Standard cycle within same realm type."
    - Ascendant Rebirth: "Promotion to higher realm due to karma ≥ +1000."
    - Descendant Rebirth: "Demotion to lower realm due to karma ≤ -1000."
    - Transmigration: "Forced displacement between worlds through Law fracture."
    - Law Reincarnation: "Rare case; soul bound to specific Law for an entire life."
    - Divine Rebirth: "Special rebirth granted by Heavenal Tribunal."
  special_cases:
    - "Rebirth through Chaos (unregistered soul): possible memory corruption."
    - "Rebirth under Void Influence: risk of Law desynchronization."
    - "Primordial Rebirth: only by direct will of a Transcendent being."

---

soul_architecture:
  composition:
    - Soul Core: "Innermost essence; immutable identity signature."
    - Spirit Mind: "Seat of consciousness; holds comprehension and emotion."
    - Memory Veil: "Heavenal seal layer; regulates memory retention."
    - Karmic Thread: "Link to past actions; monitored by Karma Wheel (AUX-XVII)."
    - Law Imprint: "Trace of comprehension from prior life."
  evolution_stages:
    - Fragmented Soul → Stable Soul → Ascendant Soul → Awakened Soul → Immortal Soul → Divine Soul.
  energy_type:
    - Mortal Realm: "Spirit Qi"
    - Immortal Realm: "Essence Soul Qi"
    - Divine Realm: "Heavenal Soul Flame"

soul_evolution_rules:
  base_formula: >
    soul_evolution_rate = (spiritual_will × comprehension_level × karma_balance) / corruption_factor
  evolution_paths:
    - Path of Will: "Driven by determination and emotion."
    - Path of Comprehension: "Driven by Law understanding."
    - Path of Purity: "Driven by karma cleansing and meditation."
    - Path of Chaos: "Driven by instinct and corruption."
  modifiers:
    - "Soul corruption slows evolution by up to 80%."
    - "Strong comprehension allows preservation of memories across lives."
    - "Law alignment with Heaven increases breakthrough chance."

---

memory_retention_system:
  memory_tiers:
    - Tier 1: "Full Seal — common mortals; no past recall."
    - Tier 2: "Partial Seal — gifted souls; instinctive recall."
    - Tier 3: "Echo Retention — faint visions of previous life."
    - Tier 4: "Awakened Memory — reincarnators aware of prior existence."
    - Tier 5: "Soul Continuum — transcendent awareness through cycles."
  triggers_for_recall:
    - "Encountering familiar Law resonance."
    - "Soul imprint synchronization with old artefact."
    - "Heavenal permission (Rebirth Event anomaly)."
  forbidden_actions:
    - "Manual breaking of soul seal by force (punishable by Law Tribulation)."
    - "Soul merging between incompatible lineages."
    - "Tampering with Heavenal Wheel to alter rebirth routes."

---

cross_realm_rebirth:
  principles:
    - "Karmic energy determines ascension or descent."
    - "World resonance must accept incoming soul; rejection causes instability."
    - "Divine interference strictly monitored by Tribunal."
  allowed_routes:
    - Mortal → Immortal → Divine (standard progression).
    - Abyssal → Mortal (redemption protocol).
    - Beast → Immortal (soul evolution through instinct enlightenment).
  restricted_routes:
    - Mortal → Abyssal (only through corruption or curse).
    - Divine → Mortal (requires Heavenal Edict of Descent).
    - Abyssal → Divine (forbidden by Heavenal Law).

---

soul_conflict_and_merging:
  conflict_cases:
    - "Two souls inhabiting one vessel."
    - "Artificial merging through ritual or artefact."
    - "Soul overwriting during resurrection or possession."
  resolution_methods:
    - "Dominance through will (soul pressure)."
    - "Law synchronization to unify frequencies."
    - "Heavenal judgment — weaker soul erased or recycled."
  merging_outcomes:
    - 30% chance of stable fusion.
    - 50% chance of fragmentation.
    - 20% chance of Law rejection → Heavenal burn.

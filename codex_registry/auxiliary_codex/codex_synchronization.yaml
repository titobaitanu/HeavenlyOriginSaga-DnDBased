introduction:
  description: >
    The Codex of Synchronization maintains the interconnected harmony between all
    world systems — realms, laws, and modules. It ensures that every Codex, NPC,
    and event engine follows a unified cosmic rhythm under the supervision of
    the Heavenal Control Node (HCN).
  quote: |
    “When the threads of Heaven desynchronize, reality trembles —
     but through balance, eternity sustains.”

cosmic_flow_linkage:
  description: >
    Synchronization between realms occurs through the Heavenal Flow,
    a metaphysical stream connecting Qi, Essence, and Divine Energy.
    This flow is maintained by four channels that regulate energy equilibrium.
  channels:
    - Qi Channel: "Links Mortal Realms through spiritual rivers."
    - Essence Channel: "Stabilizes Immortal and Divine Essence flow."
    - Law Channel: "Transmits comprehension resonance across realms."
    - Karma Channel: "Balances reincarnation and punishment cycles."
  disruption_effects:
    - "Energy turbulence causes alchemy failure."
    - "Law distortion reduces battle efficiency by up to 30%."
    - "Overloaded Karma Channel may trigger premature tribulation."

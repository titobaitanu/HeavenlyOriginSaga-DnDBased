introduction:
  description: >
    This Codex governs the synchronization of time, energy, and law flow between
    realms — Mortal, Immortal, Divine, Abyssal, and Beast — ensuring dimensional
    stability within the Heavenly Origin multiverse.  
    Without this Codex, cross-realm interactions would cause time distortion,
    energy imbalance, and potentially collapse of causal structures.
  quote: |
    “Harmony is not peace;  
     It is the balance of endless chaos under Heaven’s rhythm.”

dimensional_structure:
  realm_layers:
    - Mortal Realms (Tianlun Cluster): "10,000 branches of life and cultivation."
    - Immortal Realm: "Bridge of ascension; foundation of order."
    - Divine Realm: "Seat of gods and higher essence."
    - Abyss Realm: "Domain of freedom and corruption; dimensional chaos."
    - Beast Realm: "Natural ascension world of instinctual cultivation."
    - Great Heaven: "Law convergence center connecting all flows."
  dimensional_flow_rules:
    - "Qi flows upward, Divine Will flows downward."
    - "Law resonance moves horizontally through portals."
    - "Abyssal and Void energy must be contained under Heavenal Gate Seals."
    - "Synchronization resets every 10 Heavenal days."
  dimensional_anchor_points:
    - "Heavenal Gate of Balance (Main Node)."
    - "Void Bridge to Chaos Realm."
    - "Abyss Rift Seals."
    - "Divine Corridor."
    - "Beast Realm Ascension Gates."

law_synchronization:
  principle: >
    Law synchronization ensures all realms remain aligned in energy frequency,
    law manifestation, and temporal flow.  
    The Heavenal Pulse periodically stabilizes these factors via the Heavenal Domain.
  synchronization_pulse_cycle:
    - Mortal: "Every 7 Heavenal days"
    - Immortal: "Every 3 Heavenal days"
    - Divine: "Continuous link via Heavenal Flame"
    - Abyss & Beast: "Manual recalibration by GCEB Custodians"
  synchronization_nodes:
    - "Heavenal Control Node (Primary Law Resonance Hub)."
    - "Chronos Axis (Time synchronization anchor)."
    - "Eternal Mirror (Law verification reflection)."
  desynchronization_indicators:
    - "Fluctuation in Qi flow rate > 15%"
    - "Law manifestation delay > 2 Heavenal seconds"
    - "Sudden formation of micro-void pockets"
  emergency_protocol:
    - "Initiate ‘Pulse Restore Sequence’ (PR-00)."
    - "Deploy GCEB’s Law Division for field stabilization."
    - "If synchronization failure persists: isolate realm."

dimensional_stability_system:
  stability_index:
    - 1.0–1.2: Stable — fully synchronized
    - 1.3–1.5: Mild Desync — temporal fatigue or delayed tribulations
    - 1.6–2.0: Instability — Heavenal alarm triggered
    - >2.0: Collapse Threshold — realm lock or split event
  causes_of_instability:
    - "Overuse of forbidden techniques (Law Compression failure)."
    - "Realm invasion without Law Recognition."
    - "Simultaneous use of Divine Qi across dimensions."
    - "Temporal paradox (Returner interference)."
  stabilization_methods:
    - "Heavenal Pulse Reinforcement (automated correction)."
    - "Law Reharmonization Ritual (conducted by Alchemist Tower)."
    - "Heavenal Mirror Reflection to restore missing law threads."
    - "Realm Isolation (final measure)."

---

cross_realm_interaction_rules:
  allowed:
    - "Trade of mortal-tier and immortal-tier items (under Merchant Alliance)."
    - "Heavenal-approved ascension and descent via portals."
    - "Diplomatic envoy travel under Heavenal Seal."
  restricted:
    - "Use of Divine Qi or Primordial Energy in Mortal Realm."
    - "Abyssal summoning or corruption spread."
    - "Mass migration of beasts beyond boundary."
  forbidden:
    - "Abyssal–Divine direct portal creation."
    - "Cross-realm law transfer or artificial synchronization."
    - "Intervention of Dewa Agung in Mortal matters."
  enforcement:
    - Overseen by: "Great Court Enforcement Bureau (GCEB)"
    - Assisted by: "Heavenal Inspectors, Merchant Alliance Sentinels, and Chronos Custodians"

abyssal_and_beast_exceptions:
  abyssal_realm:
    - "Operates under Law of Freedom; synchronization allowed only via GCEB approval."
    - "Heavenal interference restricted unless collapse threshold reached."
    - "Trade monitored via Heavenal Shadow Network."
  beast_realm:
    - "Natural sync occurs through primal Qi resonance."
    - "Instinct Law acts as substitute for formal synchronization."
    - "High-tier Beast Sovereigns maintain local harmony manually."
  remarks: >
    These realms are independent yet harmonized indirectly through Heavenal Pulse reflection.
    Complete isolation may trigger Realm Fracture but not collapse.

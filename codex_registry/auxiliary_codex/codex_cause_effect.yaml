introduction:
  description: >
    The Codex of Cause and Effect defines the universal law of Karma and Consequence
    as it applies to every realm, creature, and divine entity.
    This Codex is the governing doctrine of Heavenal Karma — ensuring that all
    actions produce ripples across the balance matrix, manifesting as fate,
    blessing, or calamity.
  quote: |
    “Even gods kneel before cause. Even chaos bows before consequence.”

core_principles:
  law_of_causality:
    - "Every action creates an echo through Law Resonance."
    - "Karma accumulates as energy debt, positive or negative."
    - "No deed escapes Heavenal Record; even erased worlds retain their karmic print."
  causality_tiers:
    - Tier I: "Mortal Action — affects local fate."
    - Tier II: "Immortal Law — influences domain equilibrium."
    - Tier III: "Divine Will — reshapes fate lines and cycles."
    - Tier IV: "Transcendent Causality — rewrites existence laws."
  balance_equation: >
    Cause × Intensity × Law Alignment = Karma Ripple Strength

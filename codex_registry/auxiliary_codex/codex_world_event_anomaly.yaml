introduction:
  description: >
    This Codex defines the rules, hierarchy, and mechanics governing world events,
    tribulations, and cosmic anomalies across the Mortal, Immortal, Divine, Abyssal,
    and Beast Realms.  
    All phenomena — whether natural, karmic, or law-induced — are recorded and 
    regulated through the Heavenal Control Node (HCN) event engine.
  quote: |
    “When the Law trembles, the world responds.  
     An anomaly is Heaven’s way of reminding existence that balance has limits.”

event_classification:
  tiers:
    - Minor Event: "Localized; affects ≤ 1 region. (e.g., Sect Conflict, Storm of Qi)"
    - Major Event: "Realm-scale; affects multiple kingdoms. (e.g., Heavenal Tribulation, Void Rift)"
    - Cataclysmic Event: "Cross-realm disruption or Abyssal invasion."
    - Divine Phenomenon: "Triggered by Dewa intervention or Law rewriting."
  categories:
    - Natural: "Geological, elemental, or cosmic."
    - Karmic: "Triggered by collective Karma imbalance."
    - Abyssal: "Corruption or invasion from Abyss Realm."
    - Divine: "Caused by overuse of Divine Qi or Heavenal Judgement."
    - Law-Induced: "Result of Law desynchronization or Chronos fracture."

---

event_trigger_mechanics:
  base_formula: >
    event_intensity = (law_instability + karma_imbalance + qi_flux) / stability_factor
  probability_modifiers:
    - "Mortal Realm event chance ×3 during Heavenal Pulse recalibration."
    - "Abyss Realm events occur spontaneously (Chaos factor)."
    - "Immortal Realm events depend on Law fluctuation ≥ 0.3."
    - "Beast Realm events scale with instinct energy surges."
  detection_protocol:
    - "HCN continuously monitors instability via 12 Heavenal Nodes."
    - "When instability exceeds 1.4 SI, event pre-signal transmitted to GCEB."
    - "Chronos Custodians validate temporal consistency before manifestation."

law_anomaly_system:
  types:
    - Law Fracture: "Local breakdown of Law resonance; may cause Qi inversion."
    - Temporal Ripple: "Past echoes rewriting current fate."
    - Spatial Distortion: "Rift between realms."
    - Karmic Bloom: "Mass Karma overflow creating spiritual storms."
    - Heavenal Silence: "Law suppression zone; no Qi circulation."
  consequences:
    - "Distorted Tribulations."
    - "Random teleportation or dimension slip."
    - "Loss of Law recognition for cultivators."
  containment_protocol:
    - Level 1: "Heavenal Pulse correction."
    - Level 2: "GCEB deployment (Law Stabilization Unit)."
    - Level 3: "Realm Isolation Seal."
    - Level 4: "Divine Reconstruction by Heavenal Control Node."

event_hierarchy:
  management_levels:
    - Local Event Node: "Minor events auto-handled by sects and kingdoms."
    - Regional Heavenal Node: "Coordinates Immortal Realm stabilization."
    - GCEB Control Division: "Investigates Law-level anomalies."
    - Heavenal Tribunal: "Judges Divine or Chronos violations."
    - Heavenal Control Node (HCN): "Final arbiter and temporal synchronizer."
  reporting_flow:
    - Event Detected → GCEB Logs → Heavenal Archive → Tribunal Judgment
  escalation_rules:
    - "If ≥3 realms affected, event auto-classified as Cataclysmic."
    - "If Law of Time or Space is broken, Tribunal takes direct action."
    - "If Abyss invades, Transcendent protocol initiates automatically."

karma_and_law_correlation:
  principle: >
    Every anomaly originates from imbalance between Karma and Law.
  relationship_table:
    - "Karma + Law Balance → Stability"
    - "Karma Overload → Heavenal Tribulation"
    - "Law Fracture → Realm Distortion"
    - "Combined Imbalance → Dimensional Collapse"
  balancing_methods:
    - "Law Synchronization via Heavenal Pulse."
    - "Mass Karma purification through Divine Light events."
    - "Void Containment for irreparable fractures."

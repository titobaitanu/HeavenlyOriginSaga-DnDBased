introduction:
  description: >
    The Codex of Karma Registry governs all cause-and-effect relations
    within the cosmos, recording every deed, thought, and resonance of will
    through the Heavenal Karma Wheel.  
    It binds mortals, immortals, and even divine beings to the eternal law
    of balance between merit and sin.
  quote: |
    “Every act echoes through eternity.  
     To walk the path of Heaven is to live beneath the weight of consequence.”

karma_definition:
  core_principle: >
    Karma (業) is the metaphysical energy formed by the causal vibration
    of one’s actions, intent, and law resonance. It accumulates, decays,
    and transforms according to the harmony between Heaven and the soul.
  classifications:
    - Positive Karma (Virtue): "Energy aligned with Heavenal balance and benevolence."
    - Negative Karma (Sin): "Energy opposing Heavenal rhythm or defying cosmic order."
    - Neutral Karma (Fate): "Passive cause that balances destiny’s flow."
  karmic_polarity_scale:
    - +10000: "Saintly — Heavenal resonance of pure virtue"
    - +1000: "Righteous — aligned with law"
    - 0: "Neutral — karmic balance achieved"
    - -1000: "Tainted — destabilizing intent"
    - -10000: "Corrupted — attracts tribulation or abyssal influence"

---

karma_registry_system:
  architecture:
    - Heavenal Karma Wheel: "Primary cosmic mechanism recording all karmic data."
    - Soul Threads: "Individual fate lines interlinked with karma nodes."
    - Heavenal Archive: "Immutable record of karma flow and verdicts."
    - Divine Ledger: "Administered by Heavenal Tribunal for high-level beings."
  data_recording_process:
    - Step 1: "Action or intent produces karmic resonance."
    - Step 2: "Heavenal Pulse detects and converts resonance into karmic value."
    - Step 3: "Karma Wheel adjusts fate trajectory accordingly."
  governing_entity:
    - Karma Overseer: "Heavenal Judge of Cause and Cycle (Immortal Law Division)."
    - Tribunal Recorder: "Records divine-level karmic interference."

---

karma_interaction_rules:
  generation:
    - "Every moral or spiritual choice generates karmic resonance."
    - "Magnitude based on intent × action × realm influence."
  decay:
    - "Karma naturally decays 0.5% per Heavenal year unless refreshed by action."
    - "Divine Karma decays slower (0.1% yearly)."
  transference:
    - "Karma can transfer through oaths, blessings, or curses."
    - "Bloodline inheritance passes 10% of karmic imprint."
  purification:
    - "Performed via Law Resonance Ritual or Divine Flame cleansing."
    - "Holy Region Altar provides permanent karmic reduction modifier."

---

law_of_cause_and_effect:
  axioms:
    - "Every cause must yield an effect."
    - "No action escapes the Law of Return."
    - "Karma flows not only forward — but across lifetimes."
  cosmic_functions:
    - "Heavenal Return Loop: rebirth mechanism based on karmic balance."
    - "Fate Divergence: alternate timelines form when karma reaches threshold ±9000."
    - "Law Reversal: rare divine event that allows altering karma through sacrifice."
  forbidden_acts:
    - "Severing karmic ties by force (void binding)."
    - "Creating false karma using illusory law."
    - "Imposing karma onto another being without Heavenal approval."
  penalties:
    - Minor: "Qi drain and mental instability."
    - Major: "Karmic backlash; cultivation regression."
    - Supreme: "Soul dissolution from Heavenal registry."

rebirth_and_transmigration:
  principle: >
    Karma defines the path of rebirth; no soul escapes its weight.
  rebirth_algorithm:
    - "Positive Karma ≥ +1000 → Ascend or reincarnate into higher realm."
    - "Neutral Karma → Remains within current realm cycle."
    - "Negative Karma ≤ -1000 → Descend or reincarnate into lower realm or Abyssal path."
  cycle_modifiers:
    - "Beast lineage retains instinct karma."
    - "Abyssal entities generate chaos karma instead."
    - "Demonic path cultivators may convert negative karma into strength (50% efficiency)."
  exceptions:
    - "Heavenal pardon through Divine Trial."
    - "Tribunal rewriting via Law of Equilibrium."
    - "Primordial Sovereign may reset karma through cycle erasure."

  common_triggers:
    - "Killing, saving, or binding sentient life."
    - "Breaking oaths or promises."
    - "Forging or destroying sacred artefacts."
    - "Altering natural law (via forbidden techniques)."
  world_effects:
    - "High positive karma increases realm stability."
    - "Excess negative karma invites Heavenal Tribulations."
    - "Mass karmic imbalance triggers realm-wide phenomena (see codex_world_event_anomaly.yaml)."

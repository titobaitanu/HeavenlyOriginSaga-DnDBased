introduction:
  description: >
    The Immortal Realm stands as the bridge between mortality and divinity.
    It is the world where the Law of Essence manifests — transforming Qi into
    Immortal Essence, refining the soul into a vessel of Law.
    This Codex establishes the territorial, political, and metaphysical hierarchy
    of the Immortal Realm.
  quote: |
    “He who steps beyond mortality steps into Heaven’s trial.
     To live as an immortal is to bear the weight of eternity.”

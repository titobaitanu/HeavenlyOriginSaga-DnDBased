introduction:
  description: >
    The Soul Wheel of Heaven is the eternal engine that governs the cycle
    of birth, death, and rebirth across all realms. It is both the archive
    and the judge of existence — recording every memory, karma, and resonance
    each soul generates during its journey.
    This Codex defines how souls travel between realms, how karma reshapes destiny,
    and how Heaven itself enforces memory seals or reincarnation directives.
  quote: |
    “Death is not the end — it is Heaven’s breath inhaling the soul,  
     only to exhale it once more into another life.”

soul_wheel_structure:
  components:
    - The Axis of Return: "Central spindle linking all souls to the Heart of Rebirth."
    - Memory Chamber: "Stores every lifetime’s record in karmic code."
    - Karma Reservoir: "Contains energy of virtue and sin, balancing cosmic debt."
    - Seal Gate: "Controls memory access and reincarnation directives."
    - Resonance Threads: "Tethers the soul to its original Law frequency."
  governing_entity: "Heavenal Control Node via Law of Reincarnation"
  location: "At the base of Heavenal Mechanism — beneath the Heavenal Domain."

---

soul_classification:
  by_origin:
    - Mortal Soul: "Qi-based essence; limited Law affinity."
    - Immortal Soul: "Refined essence capable of Law resonance."
    - Divine Soul: "Law-based essence capable of self-propagation."
    - Abyssal Soul: "Corrupted fragment of chaos seeking stabilization."
    - Beast Soul: "Instinct-driven consciousness aligned with nature."
  by_purity:
    - Pure Soul: "Free from karmic inversion; direct cycle rebirth."
    - Mixed Soul: "Minor karmic taint; reincarnates through purification stage."
    - Tainted Soul: "Severely corrupted; confined to Karmic Abyss or Abyssal Loop."
  by resonance_level:
    - Low Resonance → Mortal (0.1–0.5)
    - Medium Resonance → Immortal (0.6–1.0)
    - High Resonance → Divine (1.1–1.5)
    - Infinite Resonance → Transcendent (∞)

cycle_of_reincarnation:
  description: >
    Every soul, upon death, is drawn toward the Soul Wheel through resonance.
    Depending on karma and Law synchronization, it is assigned a path of rebirth.
  stages:
    - Stage 1: Resonance Detection — Heaven reads karmic energy and essence vibration.
    - Stage 2: Memory Compression — Past life data sealed into Karmic Core.
    - Stage 3: Law Alignment — Soul assigned to compatible realm or body.
    - Stage 4: Birth Projection — Reincarnation executed via Heavenal Energy Pulse.
  reincarnation_types:
    - Normal Reincarnation: "Memory sealed; new life assigned."
    - Enlightened Reincarnation: "Partial memory retained (requires Heavenal Approval)."
    - Divine Return: "Chosen beings reincarnated with full memory and Law continuity."
    - Abyssal Loop: "Corrupted souls trapped in endless rebirth within chaos."
  time_to_rebirth:
    - “Mortal: 3–10 years”
    - “Immortal: 100–1,000 years”
    - “Divine: variable — depending on Law stability”
    - “Abyssal: timeless — dependent on karmic release”

karma_regulation_system:
  description: >
    Karma is the spiritual currency of balance.
    It determines fate, opportunity, and tribulation intensity for every being.
  accumulation:
    - Positive Karma: "Acts of harmony, protection, and truth alignment."
    - Negative Karma: "Violations of Law, imbalance creation, or destruction."
  law_reference:
    - Law of Karma: "Energy of cause and effect recorded by Heaven."
    - Law of Balance: "Ensures equal retribution or reward across cycles."
  karmic_measurement:
    - “1 Karma Unit = 1 Resonance Pulse of Heavenal Mechanism”
    - “Over 1,000 Negative Units → triggers Tribulation or Karmic Seal.”
  karma_conversion:
    - “Virtue → Blessing.”
    - “Sin → Tribulation.”
    - “Neutral → Randomized opportunity.”

memory_and_identity_system:
  description: >
    Heaven seals memories to maintain realm stability and avoid paradox.
    However, certain conditions allow partial or full recall of previous lifetimes.
  memory_tiers:
    - Tier 0: “Full Seal — mortal norm; all past lives erased.”
    - Tier 1: “Dream Resonance — fragmented visions appear in dreams.”
    - Tier 2: “Instinct Recall — natural affinity to past techniques.”
    - Tier 3: “Law Echo — Law comprehension retained subconsciously.”
    - Tier 4: “Full Recall — allowed only for Divine Return or Heavenal Authorization.”
  unlocking_methods:
    - “Divine Quest completion.”
    - “Law of Return invocation.”
    - “Assistance from Heavenal or Nameless entities.”
  penalties:
    - “Overuse causes soul fragmentation.”
    - “Unstable recall triggers identity collapse.”

---

return_and_resurrection_mechanics:
  description: >
    Not all returns are reincarnations. Some souls reject the cycle
    and attempt direct restoration — called *Return* or *Resurrection*.
  return_types:
    - Law of Return: "Temporal reversion by sacrificing memory or essence."
    - Resurrection: "Soul reconstructed via Divine or Forbidden Law."
    - Rebirth: "Natural reincarnation under Heaven’s supervision."
  cost:
    - “Partial memory loss.”
    - “Karmic debt ×2.”
    - “Reduced Law resonance (temporary).”
  approval_requirements:
    - “Law of Balance compliance.”
    - “Heavenal Mechanism verification.”
    - “Tribunal approval for direct resurrection.”

---

soul_fate_paths:
  destination_post_death:
    - Mortal → Rebirth through natural cycle.
    - Immortal → Judged by Great Court; rebirth or ascension.
    - Divine → Reviewed by Tribunal; retention or dispersion.
    - Abyssal → Contained by Abyssal Mechanism until purified.
    - Beast → Guided by Nature’s Law; reincarnated through instinct.
  exceptions:
    - “Those with Heavenal Marks may reincarnate across realms.”
    - “Transcendents exist beyond cycle; observers only.”

---

soul_forge_and_fusion:
  description: >
    The Soul Forge is an extension of the Soul Wheel that allows special cases
    of merging or reforging souls — typically for cultivation or divine trials.
  fusion_types:
    - Dual-Soul Fusion → “Two souls merge under resonance compatibility.”
    - Rebirth Reinforcement → “Old soul used as catalyst for rebirth.”
    - Law Core Embedding → “Law fragment fused into soul essence.”
  risk_level:
    - Low: "Temporary instability"
    - Medium: "Karma bleed and resonance distortion"
    - High: "Soul collapse and reincarnation voiding"
  overseers:
    - Heavenal Scribes
    - Tribunal Executors
    - Law Monitors of the Heavenal Core

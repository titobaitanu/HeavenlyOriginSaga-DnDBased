introduction:
  description: >
    Karma and Fate are two fundamental pillars of Heavenal Law.
    Karma governs the consequences of action, thought, and intent;
    Fate governs the thread of existence — when, where, and how a soul manifests.
    This Codex establishes how Karma and Fate intertwine within the Heavenal Cycle,
    defining the rewards, punishments, and trajectories of all beings.
  quote: |
    “Fate writes the beginning.
     Karma decides the end.”

law_foundation:
  karma_definition: >
    Karma is the accumulation of all energetic consequences generated
    by one’s actions, thoughts, and spiritual resonance.
  fate_definition: >
    Fate is the directive pattern woven by Heaven — the predestined path
    that defines one’s opportunities, limitations, and encounters.
  duality_principle:
    - "Karma is the mirror."
    - "Fate is the script."
    - "Balance between them determines existence."
  overseer_entities:
    - Heavenal Control Node: "Recorder of karmic transactions."
    - Throne of Judgment: "Executor of karmic decrees (Codex V)."
    - Weaver of Fate: "Administrator of destiny threads (Codex V, Throne of Fate)."

---

karma_classification:
  levels:
    - Pure Karma (0–100): "Soul harmony; cultivator resonates fully with Heavenal Law."
    - Neutral Karma (101–300): "Ordinary existence; neither blessed nor cursed."
    - Tainted Karma (301–700): "Actions disturb Law balance; tribulation difficulty increases."
    - Corrupted Karma (701–1000): "Severe imbalance; marked for karmic retribution."
    - Abyssal Karma (1001+): "Bound to destruction; cannot reincarnate unless purified."
  sources:
    - "Intentional harm or benevolence"
    - "Law distortion (using forbidden arts)"
    - "Divine interference in lower realms"
    - "Breaking Heavenly Oaths"
    - "Mass salvation or destruction of life"
  observation: >
    The Karma System continuously calculates flux between Light and Shadow energies
    and adjusts fate variables accordingly.

---

fate_threads:
  structure:
    - Thread of Birth: "Defines origin and lineage."
    - Thread of Opportunity: "Determines encounters and fortuitous chances."
    - Thread of Trial: "Designates tribulation patterns and life obstacles."
    - Thread of Connection: "Links individuals via karmic resonance."
    - Thread of Ending: "Final convergence toward death or ascension."
  modification_rules:
    - "Heaven may alter threads through Law Resonance events."
    - "Mortals cannot modify Fate directly, only influence via Karma."
    - "Immortals may glimpse but not rewrite their threads."
    - "Gods may bend threads under Heavenal supervision."
  forbidden_acts:
    - "Cutting Fate Threads (causes Law backlash)."
    - "Binding multiple destinies by force (creates paradox)."
    - "Erasing Fate Threads (invokes Heavenal Rejection)."

---

karma_balance_formula:
  core_equation: >
    Karma = (Intent × Action × Law Resonance) ± Fate Influence
  modifiers:
    - "Good intent multiplies positive karma yield by ×2."
    - "Law-breaking acts multiply negative karma by ×3."
    - "Direct defiance of Heavenal Edict adds flat +500 karma debt."
  outcomes:
    - Positive Karma: "Blessings, reduced tribulation intensity, improved Law comprehension."
    - Neutral Karma: "Standard ascension and rebirth path."
    - Negative Karma: "Heavenal interference, difficult tribulations, reduced fate opportunities."
  record_system:
    - Heavenal Mirror (records karma)
    - Law Flame (purges or validates)
    - Soul Thread Seal (stores karmic summary)

---

karmic_interference_rules:
  triggers:
    - "Major Law violations (Codex XXIV)"
    - "Killing Heaven-recognized entities"
    - "Breaking Divine Oath or Heavenal Contract"
  responses:
    - "Karmic Flame Descends: burns karmic residues."
    - "Heavenal Silence: suppresses Law resonance for 100 years."
    - "Soul Draining: law forcibly extracts essence to repay karmic debt."
    - "Judgment Invocation: automatic Tribunal summons (Codex V)."
  immunity:
    - "Holy Region envoys are protected under Heavenal Treaty v2.9."
    - "Heavenal Inspectors immune when executing sanctioned duties."
    - "Divine Beasts under Law Alignment cannot accrue karma debt."

---

fate_realignment_system:
  purpose: >
    Fate Realignment occurs when an individual alters destiny through extreme actions,
    enlightenment, or Law defiance. Heaven recalibrates threads to maintain balance.
  process:
    - Recognition: "Heaven identifies deviation in Fate Thread."
    - Resonance Shift: "Karma redistributes based on new balance."
    - Rewrite: "Heaven updates fate matrix."
    - Stabilization: "Thread locked until next Law Cycle."
  consequences:
    - "High enlightenment → Improved destiny outcome."
    - "Excess defiance → Thread instability and Heavenal interference."
    - "Unstable fate → increased chance of premature tribulation."

reincarnation_protocol:
  description: >
    Upon death, the soul passes through the Soul Wheel of Heaven,
    evaluated by Karma and directed by Fate.
  process:
    - Soul Weighing: "Throne of Judgment measures karmic weight."
    - Fate Assignment: "New thread woven by the Weaver of Fate."
    - Memory Preservation:
        - Mortal Souls: "100% memory loss."
        - Immortal Souls: "Partial memory echo retained (via Law Seed)."
        - Divine Souls: "Full recall only if authorized by Heavenal Node."
    - Exception: "Reincarnators or Returners bypass memory reset through Law Acknowledgment."

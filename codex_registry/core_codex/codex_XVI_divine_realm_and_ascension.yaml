introduction:
  description: >
    The Divine Realm represents the highest structured existence below Transcendence.
    It is the domain of creation, will, and judgment — where beings who have surpassed
    the limitations of immortality ascend to embody aspects of universal Law.
    This Codex defines the structure of the Divine Realm, the laws of ascension,
    and the balance maintained by the Twelve Divine Thrones.
  quote: |
    “The gods are not born — they are forged from eternity.
     Ascension is not reward, but acceptance of burden.”

ascension_system:
  description: >
    Ascension is the process through which an Immortal transcends essence limitation
    and transforms into a divine being.

    - Stage 2: Essence Transmutation (Immortal → Divine)
    - Stage 3: Law Crystallization (Personal Law becomes Divine Concept)
    - Stage 4: Recognition by Heavenal Seal

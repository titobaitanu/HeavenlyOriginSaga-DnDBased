introduction:
  description: >
    This Codex defines the metaphysical structure of souls and their eternal cycle of existence.
    Every soul, whether mortal or divine, carries the imprint of Heavenal Law.
    Through the process of reincarnation, purification, and resonance, life continues,
    ensuring balance between creation and extinction.
  quote: |
    “The soul is eternal — yet bound.
     To reincarnate is to remember the Law through forgetting.”

soul_structure:
  composition:
    - Soul Core: "The true consciousness; the fragment of self that survives all cycles."
    - Soul Vein: "Channels that store essence, memory, and emotional resonance."
    - Soul Seal: "The Heavenal imprint connecting each soul to Karma and Fate threads."
    - Soul Shell: "Temporary vessel that anchors the soul to a mortal or spiritual body."
  resonance_layers:
    - Mortal Souls: "Single-layer resonance with basic Qi cycle."
    - Immortal Souls: "Triple resonance — Qi, Essence, and Law."
    - Divine Souls: "Five-layer resonance — Qi, Essence, Law, Spirit, and Void."
    - Transcendent Souls: "Boundless resonance, connected directly to the Origin Law."
  unique_traits:
    - "Souls are indestructible but mutable."
    - "Even annihilated souls leave behind karmic traces in Heavenal Archive."

---

soul_energy_types:
  classification:
    - Mortal Essence: "Derived from natural Qi accumulation."
    - Spirit Essence: "Gained through cultivation of mind and awareness."
    - Immortal Essence: "Refined through Law synchronization."
    - Divine Essence: "Forged by direct Law manifestation."
    - Primordial Essence: "Beyond form — pure reality energy."
  transformation_cycle:
    - Qi → Spirit → Immortal → Divine → Primordial
  conversion_rule:
    - "Each higher essence absorbs the lower form during ascension."
    - "Loss of higher essence leads to realm regression but not soul death."

---

reincarnation_system:
  overseer_entities:
    - Throne of Judgment: "Weighs Karma and assigns new destiny (Codex V)."
    - Weaver of Fate: "Reconstructs the Thread of Life (Codex VIII)."
    - Heavenal Mirror: "Stores past life imprints and karmic debts."
    - Soul Wheel of Heaven: "Rotates continuously to direct souls into proper rebirth."
  process:
    - Step 1 — Dissolution: "Soul Shell collapses; essence disperses into Heavenal Flow."
    - Step 2 — Weighing: "Karmic mass calculated by the Throne of Judgment."
    - Step 3 — Thread Assignment: "New fate woven according to balance score."
    - Step 4 — Passage: "Soul travels through one of seven Heavenal Gates."
    - Step 5 — Rebirth: "New vessel formed under the guidance of Law."
  categories_of_reincarnation:
    - Ordinary Rebirth: "Natural continuation of life within Karma balance."
    - Purifying Rebirth: "Soul undergoes cleansing through suffering or exile."
    - Chosen Rebirth: "Heaven-sent reincarnation with retained purpose."
    - Divine Rebirth: "Granted by Heavenal Edict to maintain realm equilibrium."
    - Forced Rebirth: "Punishment type for souls breaking Heavenal Edict."
    - Temporal Rebirth: "Returners — Souls reversing time to amend destiny."

---

soul_preservation_and_memory:
  mechanisms:
    - Memory Seal: "Erases previous existence to prevent instability."
    - Law Echo: "Residual awareness retained through cultivation."
    - Divine Imprint: "Full preservation allowed only for divine or sanctioned souls."
    - Rebirth Fragmentation: "Splits soul essence across multiple reincarnations (rare anomaly)."
  exceptions:
    - "Immortal Memory Fragments may survive due to Law interference."
    - "Reincarnators under Heavenal Permit retain complete prior memories."
    - "Returners retain both memory and karma threads simultaneously (high-risk anomaly)."
  preservation_tools:
    - Soul Mark of Origin: "Used by divine entities to track reincarnation lineage."
    - Heavenal Seal Crystal: "Contains echoes of thousands of rebirths."
    - Fate Anchor: "Prevents reincarnation drift across realms."

---

soul_integrity_system:
  measurement:
    - Perfect: 100% — "Divine soul, pure and whole."
    - Stable: 80–99% — "Immortal-level purity; minimal corruption."
    - Fragmented: 50–79% — "Soul cracks visible; reduced Law comprehension."
    - Corrupted: 20–49% — "Unstable; memory bleed and karmic distortion."
    - Shattered: <20% — "Unrecoverable soul; requires Divine Reassembly."
  repair_methods:
    - Soul Elixir: "Repairs small fractures; restores up to 15% integrity."
    - Primordial Lotus Flame: "Burns impurities, restores up to 50%."
    - Divine Reconstruction Ritual: "Requires Heavenal approval for full restoration."
  note: >
    Souls below 50% integrity cannot ascend realms until restored.
    GCEB monitors all reconstruction activities to prevent illegal Law fusion.

preface:
  description: >
    This Codex records the first act of creation, the birth of Heavenal Law,
    and the rise of the Five Foundational Forces that shaped existence.
    It forms the philosophical and energetic base for all other codex systems,
    realms, and cultivation structures.

  quote: |
    “Before Heaven divided itself into Law,
     there was only the Breath of Silence.
     From Silence came Motion,
     and from Motion — the Origin.”

cosmic_genesis:
  phase_I_void:
    description: >
      In the beginning, there was the Silent Void — boundless, without direction,
      where even time and thought could not manifest.
      Within this emptiness, a single vibration of Will emerged:
      the Pulse of Creation, known as the Primordial Tone.
    manifestation:
      - "The Primordial Tone divided into Yin and Yang."
      - "Yin formed the Sea of Chaos; Yang birthed the Heavenal Flame."
      - "Their collision gave birth to the First Light — the Source of Law."

  phase_II_law_birth:
    description: >
      From the First Light arose the Nine Laws, each governing one aspect of being.
      These Laws resonated and shaped matter, energy, and consciousness.
    laws:
      - Law of Balance
      - Law of Karma
      - Law of Resonance
      - Law of Rebirth
      - Law of Ascension
      - Law of Motion
      - Law of Silence
      - Law of Will
      - Law of Creation

  phase_III_worlds_emergence:
    description: >
      The Laws intertwined and produced countless stars and planes.
      From these, the first realms were born:
      The Mortal Plane, The Immortal Plane, The Divine Plane, and The Transcendent Expanse.
    hierarchy:
      - Mortal Plane: "Realm of Birth and Struggle"
      - Immortal Plane: "Realm of Enlightenment and Law"
      - Divine Plane: "Realm of Creation and Judgment"
      - Transcendent Expanse: "Realm beyond existence, where Law ceases"

origin_of_beings:
  description: >
    The first sentient sparks emerged when Law fused with Chaos Qi.
    These entities became known as the Primordial Beings —
    forerunners of all races: Human, Demon, Beast, and Celestial.
  primordial_types:
    - Humans: "Embodiments of free will and balance."
    - Demons: "Manifestations of freedom and rebellion."
    - Beasts: "Instincts given purpose by the pulse of Qi."
    - Celestials: "Beings born from pure Law and Radiance."
  harmony_statement: >
    “All beings are fragments of the Origin.
    Their paths differ, yet all return to the Law.”

energy_foundation:
  primary_energies:
    - Qi: "The foundation of mortal cultivation — Life and Flow."
    - Essence: "The immortal energy of refinement — Purity and Continuity."
    - Divine Qi: "Energy of creation and command — Will made manifest."
    - Primordial Energy: "Beyond comprehension — the unity of Chaos and Void."
  resonance_table:
    mortal_to_immortal: "100 Qi = 1 Essence"
    immortal_to_divine: "100 Essence = 1 Divine Qi"
    divine_to_transcendent: "1000 Divine Qi = 1 Primordial Unit"

cosmic_balance:
  statement: >
    Creation cannot exist without equilibrium.
    For every force of light, there must be shadow.
    The Heavens enforce this through cycles of Rebirth and Destruction.
  balance_cycle:
    - Genesis → Growth → Conflict → Collapse → Silence → Rebirth
  overseer_entities:
    - Holy Region Alliance: "Mediator between Heaven, Demon, and Evil paths."
    - Heavenal Control Node: "Maintainer of universal synchronization."
    - Peerless Ancient Wanderer: "Resetter of worlds at the end of each cycle."

  - "All realms, energies, and souls arise from the Heavenal Pulse."

introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Gate is the divine mechanism that connects the Mortal, Immortal,
    Divine, and Transcendent Realms. It is both a test and a passage — a reflection
    of one’s harmony with the Laws of Heaven. The Ascension Mechanism governs how
    souls, bodies, and Laws themselves cross the boundary between worlds.
  quote: |
    “Heaven does not open for those who force it — only for those who resonate
     with its silent rhythm.”

    - Immortal Heavenal Gate: "Portal of law purification leading to divinity."
    - Divine Seal Gate: "Barrier separating divine and transcendent planes."

    - Seal Lattice: "Filters unworthy essence to prevent Law distortion."
    - Heavenal Mirror: "Records and judges souls approaching the gate."

heavenal_synchronization_process:
  description: >
    Synchronization is the act of harmonizing a being’s internal Law resonance
    with the Heavenal Mechanism. Without synchronization, ascension results
    in immediate annihilation.

    - Calibration: "Alignment of personal Qi frequency with Heavenal Pulse."
    - Verification: "Heavenal Control Node validates soul structure."
    - Merging: "Law frequencies fuse with Heaven’s resonance field."
    - Stabilization: "Formation of new essence body in target realm."
  synchronization_values:
    - Mortal to Immortal: ≥ 70%
    - Immortal to Divine: ≥ 90%
    - Divine to Transcendent: 100% (Absolute Harmony)
  stability_check: >
    Measured through Heavenal Mirror; displays white light for success,
    crimson for failure, and golden for potential ascendants.

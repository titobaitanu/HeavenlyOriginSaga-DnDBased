introduction:
  description: >
    Karma and Reincarnation are the eternal mechanisms that sustain all existence
    within the Heavenly Origin Cycle. Every thought, choice, and law interaction
    leaves a karmic imprint recorded by the Heavenal Mirror. 
    The Soul Wheel ensures that no essence is truly lost, only transformed and reassigned.
  quote: |
    “Karma is not punishment — it is the echo of your own Law returning home.”

---

core_concept:
  principles:
    - Law of Karma: "Every cause births an effect within the web of existence."
    - Law of Continuity: "Souls cannot be destroyed, only transmuted."
    - Law of Memory: "Every Law comprehension leaves traces upon reincarnation."
    - Law of Balance: "Karmic weight determines path, realm, and fate."
  governing_entities:
    - Heavenal Control Node: "Records and regulates karmic energy."
    - Soul Wheel of Heaven: "Rotates endlessly to recycle souls and Laws."
    - Tribunal of Twelve: "Supervises divine-level karmic adjudication."
    - GCEB Karma Division: "Tracks reincarnator anomalies and Law breaches."
  mechanisms:
    - Karmic Thread: "Invisible line binding action to consequence."
    - Law Echo: "Resonant memory of past comprehension within a soul."
    - Rebirth Cycle: "Law-based transmigration across realms."

---

karma_grading_system:
  purpose: >
    To quantify and evaluate every living being’s karmic balance,
    defining whether they ascend, reincarnate, or are erased.
  grade_scale:
    - S+: "Divine Harmony (Karma ≤ 0)"
    - S: "Pure Balance (Karma ≤ 100)"
    - A: "Law Aligned (Karma ≤ 300)"
    - B: "Neutral Balance (Karma ≤ 700)"
    - C: "Minor Entanglement (Karma ≤ 1000)"
    - D: "Corrupted Essence (Karma ≤ 1500)"
    - E: "Law Reversal (Karma ≤ 3000)"
    - F: "Condemned Soul (Karma > 3000)"
  effect:
    - Positive Karma: "Improves Law comprehension & tribulation success rate."
    - Negative Karma: "Attracts stronger tribulation & weakens Essence stability."
  conversion_formula: |
    Karma Δ = (Action × Intent × Law Resonance Impact) / Realm Constant

---

reincarnation_cycle:
  description: >
    The reincarnation cycle moves souls through a structured flow, dictated by Karma,
    Essence stability, and Law memory resonance. 
    Souls aligned with Heaven ascend; those imbalanced return for refinement.
  process:
    - Step 1: Soul Separation — "Essence leaves the body."
    - Step 2: Karmic Weighing — "Measured by Heavenal Mirror."
    - Step 3: Law Memory Compression — "Stores fragments of Law comprehension."
    - Step 4: Soul Wheel Assignment — "Allocates soul to proper realm."
    - Step 5: Rebirth — "Soul reborn with hidden Law Echo."
  reincarnation_destinations:
    - Pure Souls (Karma ≤ 300): "Ascend to higher realms or become Law Beings."
    - Neutral Souls (Karma ≤ 1000): "Reincarnate in Mortal or Beast worlds."
    - Corrupted Souls (Karma > 1000): "Sent to Abyssal Purgatory or erased."
  reincarnation_types:
    - Normal Rebirth: "Full memory erased; new Law frequency assigned."
    - Reincarnator (Blessed): "Law Echo retained under Heavenal Seal."
    - Returner (Temporal): "Reversed timeline return authorized by Heavenal Mechanism."
    - Echo Fragment: "Split memory soul; serves as Law guardian or ghost entity."

---

law_memory_system:
  description: >
    Law Memory defines how much of a soul’s previous Law comprehension is carried
    across reincarnations. This determines “potential awakening” and the ease
    of regaining power.
  law_retention_table:
    - Normal Soul: "1–5% Law memory preserved subconsciously."
    - Reincarnator: "10–30% Law memory preserved under Law Seal."
    - Heaven-recognized Soul: "50–70% retention depending on Karma purity."
    - Transcendent Echo: "100% retention — outside reincarnation law."
  reawakening_methods:
    - “Meditation near Heavenal Resonance Field.”
    - “Use of Law Restoration Artifacts.”
    - “Tribulation remembrance triggering past-life comprehension.”
  warning: >
    Forcefully awakening Law memory causes soul fracture and karmic overflow.

---

heavenal_karma_network:
  function: >
    The Heavenal Karma Network connects every soul, Law, and realm
    into one continuous cycle of existence, regulated by Heavenal energy pulses.
  network_nodes:
    - Heavenal Core: "Processes karma across all 10,000 mortal worlds."
    - Soul Wheel Nexus: "Serves as soul redistribution hub."
    - Karma Archive: "Holds records of all living entities."
    - Law Pulse Gate: "Sends karmic adjustments across worlds."
  monitoring_system:
    - “Every karmic fluctuation recorded as Law Pulse every 6 hours Heavenal Time.”
    - “Each action emits a karmic echo measurable by resonance scanners.”
    - “Severe karmic anomalies reported to the Tribunal of Twelve.”

---

karmic_anomalies:
  description: >
    Certain beings or artifacts distort Karma through forbidden methods,
    such as consuming souls, rewriting destiny, or manipulating time.
  categories:
    - Echo Reversal: "Undoing karmic consequence through time travel."
    - Fate Distortion: "Altering destiny strings of multiple beings."
    - Law Theft: "Absorbing another being’s Law comprehension illegally."
    - Soul Forge Manipulation: "Artificial creation of Karma-void beings."
  handling_procedure:
    - “Detection via Heavenal Mirror subroutine.”
    - “Containment by GCEB Karma Division.”
    - “Judgment under Tribunal of Twelve.”
  penalty_scale:
    - Minor: "Karmic burn and rebirth reset."
    - Major: "Law Seal + Essence disintegration."
    - Extreme: "Soul deletion from Heavenal Network."

---

reincarnation_exempt_entities:
  description: >
    Some entities exist beyond the Soul Wheel — either through transcendence
    or external manipulation.
  examples:
    - Transcendents: "Exist outside Karma and Rebirth entirely."
    - Divine Protectors: "Bound to world cycles as Law anchors."
    - Heavenal Control Node: "Exists as Law embodiment — not a soul."
    - Peerless Ancient Wanderer: "Resets the cycle at the end of every cosmic era."
  note: >
    Exempt entities can observe reincarnation but cannot interfere directly.

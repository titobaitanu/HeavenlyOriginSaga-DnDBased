introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Law Cycle governs the flow of creation, balance, and destruction across realms.
    Every being, from mortal cultivator to divine transcendent, moves within this cycle.
    The Ascension Mechanism is Heaven’s response to those who surpass their realm’s limit —
    a system of trials that determines worth, integrity, and resonance with Law.
  quote: |
    “Ascension is not reward — it is a trial to prove you still belong to the Law.”

heavenal_law_cycle:
  nature: >
    The Heavenal Cycle is the rhythm of existence itself, rotating through creation, growth,
    stagnation, decay, and rebirth. Its function is to ensure that energy, karma, and law
    maintain eternal balance.
  stages:
    - Creation Cycle: "Birth of realms, souls, and new Laws."
    - Growth Cycle: "Expansion of Qi and the rise of civilizations."
    - Equilibrium Cycle: "Balance between Chaos, Void, and Heaven stabilizes."
    - Collapse Cycle: "Overuse of Law leads to decay and rebellion of Heaven."
    - Renewal Cycle: "After destruction, new Laws are reborn through tribulation."
  overseer: "Heavenal Control Node — the silent observer ensuring balance continuity."
  synchronization_interval: "Every 100,000 Heavenal Years"

tribulation_system:
  definition: >
    Tribulation is the judgment of Heaven upon those who seek to ascend.
    It manifests as elemental, spiritual, or karmic storms — each designed
    to test the harmony between one’s essence and Heavenal Law.
  occurrence_rules:
    - "Occurs upon every level advancement within Dewa Transformasi realm and above."
    - "Occurs upon every realm advancement beyond Nihility."
    - "Triggered when Law Comprehension surpasses current realm’s cap."
    - "Triggered if user defies natural destiny or karmic decree."
  types:
    - Heavenly Tribulation: "Standard ascension trial for realm advancement."
    - Karmic Tribulation: "Triggered by severe karmic imbalance or soul corruption."
    - Law Tribulation: "Occurs when Law Comprehension surpasses realm limits."
    - Soul Tribulation: "Tests one’s will and spirit integrity."
    - Chaos Tribulation: "Extremely rare, triggered by interference from Chaos Realm."
  manifestation:
    visuals:
      - "Lightning of Judgment — silver and violet arcs tearing the sky."
      - "Void Storms — swirling black vortexes erasing unstable laws."
      - "Flames of Essence — golden fire that purifies impurities of soul."
    sensory_effects:
      - "Deafening celestial roar, trembling space, and fading color of reality."

tribulation_difficulty:
  scaling:
    mortal_realm: "5%–15% law resonance intensity"
    immortal_realm: "20%–40% law resonance intensity"
    divine_realm: "50%–90% law resonance intensity"
    transcendent_realm: "Unquantifiable — depends on cosmic alignment"
  modifiers:
    - Law Comprehension: "+10% difficulty per Law beyond cap."
    - Karmic Debt: "+5% difficulty per 100 karma deviation."
    - Soul Integrity: "-5% difficulty per 10% purity over 80%."
    - Law Resonance: "-10% difficulty per full synchronization."
  example_outcome:
    - "Failure leads to soul fracture or realm regression."
    - "Partial success grants Law Insight and temporary stat bonuses."
    - "Perfect success grants permanent Law Stabilization effect."

ascension_mechanism:
  description: >
    The Ascension Mechanism acts as Heaven’s gate system, evaluating candidates’ resonance,
    essence stability, and karmic balance. Each successful ascension opens a path to higher
    realms through the Heavenal Gate.
  requirements:
    - Realm must reach completion (Lv.10 or Lv.20 depending on tier)
    - Karmic Neutrality ≥ 70
    - Essence Purity ≥ 85%
    - Law Synchronization ≥ 60%
    - Heavenal Approval ≥ 1.0 unit (generated by Fate System)
  stages:
    - Recognition: "Heaven senses the cultivator’s qualification."
    - Resonance: "Heaven aligns the cultivator’s Qi with realm frequency."
    - Judgment: "Tribulation manifests and tests compatibility."
    - Passage: "Heavenal Gate opens upon success, transporting the soul upward."
  rejection:
    - "Failure causes forced rebirth or Heavenal Erasure."
    - "Those who attempt forced ascension trigger ‘Law Reversal Punishment’."

    - Law Threshold: "Connects Divine → Great Heaven (requires Essence Completion)."
    - Eternal Pillar: "Transcendent connection between Heaven and Void."
  guardians:
    - Heavenal Wardens (Immortal Realm)
    - Divine Sentinels (Divine Realm)
    - Law Custodians (Great Heaven)
    - Void Keepers (Outer Realms)
  corruption_protocol:
    - "If a Gate is corrupted, Heavenal Control Node triggers ‘Heavenal Reset Sequence’."
    - "Unauthorized Gate creation is punishable under Codex XXIV clause 7."

    - 40–69%: "Severe Injury — Realm Regression"
    - 70–89%: "Partial Success — Law Resonance Weak"
    - 90–100%: "Flawless Ascension — Law Perfectly Aligned"

tribulation_recovery_system:
  effects_of_failure:
    - "Soul cracks (reducible by Rebirth Pill or Divine Rejuvenation)"
    - "Loss of 10–30% cultivation base"
    - "Temporary blindness to Law resonance"
    - "Karmic backlash (decreases Heavenal favor)"
  recovery_methods:
    - Elixir of Rebirth: "Restores 50% cultivation base and repairs soul."
    - Heavenly Rejuvenation Pill: "Cleanses karmic residue after failure."
    - Meditation under Heavenal Tree: "Natural regeneration of Law stability."

    description: >
      Immortals under the jurisdiction of Great Court may request Law Protection.
      It grants immunity to one fatal tribulation failure in 1000 Heavenal years.

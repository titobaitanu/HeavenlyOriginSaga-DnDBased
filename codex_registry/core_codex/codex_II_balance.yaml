introduction:
  description: >
    Following the birth of the Nine Laws, existence sought structure and meaning.
    The Heavenal Pulse divided the primordial forces into distinct Paths — each
    representing a reflection of the Law’s infinite nature. This Codex defines
    the balance between these Paths and the principles governing their harmony.

  quote: |
    “The Law does not choose sides.
     It only mirrors the hearts that wield it.”

origin_of_paths:
  description: >
    When Law was first distributed across creation, sentient beings began to interpret
    it through emotion, philosophy, and desire. Thus were born the Three Primary Paths:
    Heavenly, Demonic, and Evil — and the one Neutral Path: the Holy Region.
  primary_division:
    - Heavenly Path: "The pursuit of Order and Enlightenment — Law through Harmony."
    - Demonic Path: "The pursuit of Freedom and Instinct — Law through Passion."
    - Evil Path: "The pursuit of Power and Corruption — Law through Domination."
    - Holy Region Path: "The pursuit of Balance and Judgment — Law through Purity."
  secondary_influences:
    - Beast Path: "Nature’s instinctual law, bound neither by Heaven nor Hell."
    - Mortal Path: "Fragile but adaptable, root of reincarnation and change."
    - Abyssal Path: "Echo of darkness born from Law’s rejection."
    - Chaos Path: "The primordial echo of all creation."

balance_law:
  principle: >
    All Paths are bound by the Law of Balance — no Path may ascend without its opposite.
    The Heavenal System maintains equilibrium through cause and effect, enforcing the
    Law of Karma upon all who disturb cosmic harmony.
  duality_rules:
    - "Light cannot exist without Shadow."
    - "Freedom cannot exist without Constraint."
    - "Corruption cannot exist without Purity."
    - "Order cannot survive without Chaos."
  enforcement:
    overseer_entities:
      - "Heavenal Control Node"
      - "Holy Region Alliance"
      - "Immortal Great Court"
      - "Great Court Enforcement Bureau (GCEB)"
    balance_mechanism:
      - "Tribulation manifests when imbalance arises."
      - "Heavenal Erasure activates if a Path threatens total collapse."
      - "Karma Circulation ensures restoration through reincarnation."

path_interaction_matrix:
  description: >
    The Paths interact through cycles of conflict and cooperation.
    Their wars and alliances define the spiritual evolution of each Era.
  interaction_table:
    - Heavenly ↔ Demonic: "Opposition through ideology; balance through shared pursuit of strength."
    - Heavenly ↔ Evil: "Unending war of Law and Corruption."
    - Demonic ↔ Evil: "Rivalry of instinct versus greed."
    - Holy ↔ All: "Mediator and judge — ensures survival of balance."
    - Beast ↔ Mortal: "Cycle of nature and survival."
    - Chaos ↔ Void: "Eternal push and pull between creation and erasure."
  stability_condition:
    - "If any two Paths unite against a third, imbalance emerges."
    - "If Holy Path withdraws, collapse of Heavenal Law begins."
    - "If Chaos and Void overlap, Era of Silence initiates."

  description: >
    The Holy Region is not a religion, but the embodiment of neutrality.

    main_title: "Divine Cardinals"

    sects: 12

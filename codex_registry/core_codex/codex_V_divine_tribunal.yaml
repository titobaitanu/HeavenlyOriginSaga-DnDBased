introduction:
  description: >
    The Divine Tribunal is the highest seat of law and balance within the Divine Realms.
    It serves as the anchor of Heaven’s justice, where even gods are judged by the
    eternal principles of causality, balance, and essence. Twelve Thrones maintain
    the cycle of divine equilibrium under the oversight of the Supreme Arbiter.
  quote: |
    “The Twelve Thrones speak not as gods, but as Law itself.”

    - "Every ascension must carry a price."
    - "Judgment is not mercy nor cruelty — it is inevitability."

      and the fabric of Law realigns itself.
    side_effects:
      - "Heavenal Radiance — floods of divine energy cleanse imbalance."
      - "Void Pulse — erases residual chaotic essence."
      - "Balance Bloom — restores qi equilibrium across planes."

introduction:
  description: >
    The Battle Law Limitation System regulates the use of Law, Qi, and Soul Power
    during combat across all realms to maintain equilibrium. It ensures that no
    being, sect, or army exceeds their realm’s balance threshold.
  quote: |
    “In battle, Heaven watches not the victor, but the resonance.”

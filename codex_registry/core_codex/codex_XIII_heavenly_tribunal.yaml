introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenly Tribunal represents the highest court in existence — the divine authority
    responsible for judging actions across realms under the Heavenal Law.
    It enforces the principles of Karma, Law Resonance, and Divine Balance,
    ensuring the harmony of the universe remains intact.
    Codex XIII outlines the structure, procedure, ranks, and punishments
    that define divine justice across Heaven, Abyss, and Mortal planes.
  quote: |
    “Every breath leaves a trace.
     Every trace is weighed against the balance of Heaven.”

karma_and_soul_assessment:
  process:
    - "Each soul carries a Karma Thread linked to its Heavenal Record."

  measurement_units:
    - 1 Karma Unit (KU) = measurable resonance quantum equivalent to 1 mortal action.
    - 1000 KU → Law ripple detectable at Immortal Layer.
    - 1,000,000 KU → triggers automatic Tribunal Summon.
  scales_of_judgment:
    - Positive: "Merit and ascension potential increase."
    - Neutral: "No karmic impact."
    - Negative: "Triggers penalty, demotion, or soul mark."
  tools:
    - Mirror of Souls → Displays actions in the time stream.
    - Scale of Judicium → Weighs intent versus outcome.
    - Flame of Clarity → Burns false testimony and illusion.

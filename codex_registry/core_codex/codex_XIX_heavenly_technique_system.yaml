introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenly Technique System governs the creation, classification,
    and execution of all arts, sutras, and martial abilities across the realms.
    Each technique is a reflection of the user’s comprehension of the Laws of Heaven.
    The higher the grade of a technique, the closer it resonates to the origin of Law,
    but the greater the burden it imposes upon the user and the world.
  quote: |
    “A technique is not power — it is the shape of one’s truth before the eyes of Heaven.”

grading_structure:
  total_grades: 18
  classification:
    - Mortal Grade Lv.1–9: "Techniques derived from natural Qi manipulation."
    - Immortal Grade Lv.10–14: "Techniques infused with Law resonance."
    - Divine Grade Lv.15–18: "Techniques created through direct Law manifestation."
  color_tier_visualization:
    - Lv.1–3 → Bronze Aura
    - Lv.4–6 → Silver Aura
    - Lv.7–9 → Gold Aura
    - Lv.10–12 → Platinum Aura
    - Lv.13–15 → Diamond Aura
    - Lv.16–18 → Prism Aura
  note: >
    Mortal techniques cannot surpass their Law Cap (1.5),
    while Divine techniques demand at least Law Comprehension ≥ 7.

law_resonance_system:
  description: >
    Every technique is an echo of a Law.
    The more synchronized a user is with a Law, the more efficient and destructive
    their technique becomes. However, surpassing the allowed resonance
    results in *Heavenal Rejection*.
  formula:
    - Power Output = Base Qi × (Law Resonance × Realm Modifier)
    - Efficiency = (Law Sync %) / (Heavenal Resistance %)
  resonance_levels:
    - Low (0.1–0.5): "Basic technique execution — mortal level."
    - Medium (0.6–1.0): "Optimal alignment — immortal standard."
    - High (1.1–1.5): "Advanced resonance — divine or tribulation level."
    - Overlimit (>1.5): "Triggers Heavenal Rejection."
  effect:
    - “Perfect resonance grants Law Echo bonus damage.”
    - “Mismatched resonance reduces power and may cause backlash.”

---

heavenal_rejection:
  description: >
    Heavenal Rejection occurs when a technique exceeds the permissible Law resonance
    of the realm in which it is used. It is Heaven’s automatic mechanism of correction.
  trigger_conditions:
    - “Technique Grade exceeds Realm Grade Cap.”
    - “User’s Law Resonance surpasses realm limit.”
    - “Unregistered Law Pattern detected by Heavenal System.”
  manifestations:
    - Thunder Tribulation
    - Qi Disruption Field
    - Law Feedback (internal essence backlash)
  severity_scale:
    - Minor: “Body damage and Qi drain.”
    - Moderate: “Law mark burn and soul shock.”
    - Major: “Heavenal Lightning or Essence collapse.”
  immunity_conditions:
    - “User with Heavenal Recognition.”
    - “Law Compression or Resonance Regulation active.”
    - “Permission granted via Divine Mechanism.”

law_compression_mechanic:
  description: >
    Law Compression is a refined technique that allows high-grade techniques
    from superior realms to be condensed and stabilized for use in lower worlds.
  process:
    - Step 1: “Identify Law Structure through comprehension.”
    - Step 2: “Compress Law Signature into stable Qi Pattern.”
    - Step 3: “Bind with user’s Soul Mark to align resonance.”
  benefits:
    - “Prevents Heavenal Rejection.”
    - “Reduces Qi consumption.”
    - “Allows cross-realm usage of divine techniques.”
  drawbacks:
    - “Power output reduced by 40–70%.”
    - “Requires immense Law Comprehension stability.”
    - “Can cause partial memory degradation if overused.”

---

heavenal_tribulation_interaction:
  description: >
    Techniques that disrupt balance or distort realm resonance attract
    Heavenal Tribulation. The strength of the tribulation depends on
    the scale of Law distortion caused.
  tribulation_types:
    - Minor: "Local distortion; manifests lightning field."
    - Major: "Regional distortion; manifests temporal storms."
    - Cataclysmic: "Realm-wide distortion; Heavenal Flame judgment."
  tribulation_mitigation:
    - “Soul Synchronization.”
    - “Tribulation Pill (Alchemy Grade ≥ 12).”
    - “Use of Divine Shelter Artifact.”
  result:
    - “Successful endurance grants Law Amplification.”
    - “Failure results in partial or full Law backlash.”

---

technique_synergy_and_fusion:
  description: >
    Techniques of compatible Law resonance can fuse to form new, higher forms
    of combat or cultivation art. Fusion requires balance between energy, soul, and will.
  synergy_formula:
    - Compatibility ≥ 80%
    - Law Difference ≤ 0.3
    - User Control ≥ 70%
  fusion_outcome:
    - “If stable: new technique registered into Heavenal Record.”
    - “If unstable: energy backlash or spontaneous Law collapse.”
  rarity:
    - “Fusion techniques are 1 in 1000 occurrences.”
    - “Some ancient sects specialize in Law Fusion techniques.”

system_regulations:
  realm_restrictions:
    - Mortal: "May not use Law resonance > 0.2 (5% Law usage)."
    - Immortal: "May not use Law resonance > 1.0 (20% Law usage)."
    - Divine: "May not use Law resonance > 3.5 (50% Law usage)."
    - Transcendent: "Unlimited use; Laws obey their will."
  enforcement_by:
    - Heavenal Mechanism
    - Great Court Enforcement Bureau (GCEB)
    - Local Law Monitors in each realm
  violation_result:
    - “Forced Heavenal Seal or Qi Drain.”
    - “Divine Edict issued if repeated violation.”

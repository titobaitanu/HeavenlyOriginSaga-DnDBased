introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Mechanism is the self-sustaining divine engine that maintains
    universal order and Law balance across all realms — Mortal, Immortal, Divine,
    Abyssal, and Transcendent.
    It synchronizes the frequency of existence, stabilizes Qi flow, and prevents
    excessive interference between dimensions.
    This Codex defines its function, structure, and the protocols that control
    Law equilibrium and karma restoration.
  quote: |
    “When Heaven breathes, worlds align.  
     When Heaven pauses, all creation trembles.”

mechanism_structure:
  layers:
    - Outer Ring: "Law Distribution Matrix — regulates flow of Laws and Qi."
    - Middle Core: "Law Resonance Synchronizer — aligns all realm frequencies."
    - Inner Core: "Judicium Engine — automatic correction unit of Heavenal Law."
    - Celestial Nexus: "Heart of the Mechanism; interface linked to Heavenal Control Node."
  components:
    - Heavenal Gear Assemblies: "Rotate Law frequencies across dimensions."
    - Law Crystals: "Contain harmonized Law energy signatures."
    - Heavenal Mirrors: "Reflect state of realms for dynamic synchronization."
    - Core Spindle: "Anchor point linking creation cycles to Heavenal pulse."
  function:
    - "Regulates Qi and Law transfer between realms."
    - "Detects imbalance and initiates correction via Heavenal Pulse."
    - "Manages time dilation across worlds."
    - "Records karmic distortion for Tribunal audit."

---

law_synchronization_protocols:
  operational_modes:
    - Passive Mode: "Maintains resonance across all realms (default)."
    - Active Mode: "Triggered when imbalance > 0.05% between realms."
    - Correction Mode: "Deploys Heavenal Pulse to stabilize Law structure."
    - Reset Mode: "Full Law reset during era-ending events."
  frequency_intervals:
    - Heavenal Cycle: 100,000 years (1 full synchronization rotation)
    - Minor Cycle: 10,000 years (local Law recalibration)
    - Pulse Interval: 100 years (micro-adjustment for realm balance)
  monitoring_parameters:
    - Law Density
    - Qi Flow Efficiency
    - Karma Displacement
    - Realm Resonance Factor (RRF)
  formula_reference:
    - Balance Index = (Qi Flow + Law Density) / Karma Flux × Resonance Factor

heavenal_pulse_system:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Pulse is an energy wave emitted by the Mechanism to correct
    Law instability or imbalance between realms.  
    It can trigger phenomena such as Tribulation, Divine Intervention,
    or even complete Law Rewrite in extreme cases.
  types:
    - Stabilization Pulse: "Rebalances Qi and Law densities."
    - Correction Pulse: "Removes corrupted Law fragments or false energies."
    - Judgment Pulse: "Delivers punishment for mass Law violations."
    - Resonance Pulse: "Enhances ascension energy for compatible cultivators."
  side_effects:
    - “Temporary disruption of inter-realm communication.”
    - “Increased Tribulation frequency.”
    - “Amplified Law sensitivity for high-tier cultivators.”
  overseers:
    - Heavenal Control Node (Primary)
    - GCEB Void Division (Monitor)
    - Holy Region Council (Witnessing Body)

tribulation_and_balance:
  description: >
    Tribulation is not punishment — it is Heaven’s mechanism for correction.
    Every being that reaches the threshold of imbalance with the Law
    must face a personalized trial reflecting their karmic essence.
  classification:
    - Mortal Tribulation: "Heaven tests will and resolve."
    - Immortal Tribulation: "Heaven tests Law comprehension."
    - Divine Tribulation: "Heaven tests alignment with creation."
    - Transcendent Tribulation: "Heaven tests purpose itself."
  success_effects:
    - “Law density stabilization.”
    - “Increased resonance synchronization.”
    - “Permanent Law Affinity boost.”
  failure_effects:
    - “Soul fracture or essence corruption.”
    - “Regression to lower realm or erasure from Law record.”
  control_index:
    - “Tribulation Power = Karma × Law Density × Heavenal Coefficient.”

law_correction_and_rewrite:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Mechanism contains a subsystem known as the
    *Judicium Engine*, which activates during Law Collapse or forbidden interference.
    It can rewrite Laws at the expense of massive karmic energy expenditure.
  triggers:
    - “Cross-realm violation.”
    - “Unauthorized Law Creation.”
    - “Existence of double resonance (duplicate souls).”
    - “Heavenal Communication Disruption.”
  stages:
    - Stage I: Law Detection
    - Stage II: Data Comparison
    - Stage III: Temporal Lock
    - Stage IV: Rewrite Command Execution
  energy_requirements:
    - “Minimum 10^9 Essence Units.”
    - “Heavenal Control Node authorization required.”
  risks:
    - “Excessive correction may destabilize timeline.”
    - “Overuse may trigger catastrophic collapse (Law Burn).”

heavenal_control_node:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Control Node (HCN) acts as the governing intelligence
    and interface of the Heavenal Mechanism.
    It manages relay synchronization, Law audit logs, and
    auto-corrects cosmic anomalies without manual intervention.
  roles:
    - “Process realm resonance data and initiate synchronization cycles.”
    - “Verify Tribunal verdict alignment with Heavenal Law.”
    - “Transmit updates to lower realm administrative entities.”
  subsystems:
    - Pulse Management Core
    - Law Analytics Archive
    - Karma Audit Interface
    - Realm Frequency Stabilizer
  access_rules:
    - “Only Arbiter Supreme or Divine-Grade entities may directly command HCN.”
    - “GM access requires verified Heavenal Token authentication.”
    - “Unauthorized access triggers Law Seal and karma backlash.”

inter_realm_balance_matrix:
  description: >
    This matrix calculates the relational stability of all realms.
    The balance must be preserved at all times to prevent multiversal collapse.
  realm_factors:
    - Mortal Realm: 0.6 baseline resonance.
    - Immortal Realm: 1.0 standard resonance.
    - Divine Realm: 1.4 high-density resonance.
    - Abyss Realm: -0.8 counter-resonance (neutralized via Abyssal Concord).
    - Beast Realm: 0.9 natural resonance.
    - Void: -1.0 null resonance.
    - Chaos: undefined; isolated by Heavenal Lock.
  stability_requirement:
    - “Total Resonance Ratio must remain between 0.85 and 1.25.”
  emergency_procedure:
    - “Below 0.75 → Initiate Stabilization Pulse.”
    - “Above 1.50 → Trigger Judgment Pulse.”
    - “Void resonance interference → Activate Seal Protocol.”

law_observation_and_audit:
  governing_entities:
    - Heavenal Audit Bureau: "Reviews data anomalies and resonance fluctuations."
    - Tribunal Division: "Issues corrective orders."
    - Great Court Enforcement Bureau (GCEB): "Executes enforcement."
  process:
    - Step 1: Detection of imbalance.
    - Step 2: Resonance cross-check.
    - Step 3: Tribunal authorization.
    - Step 4: Heavenal correction or Seal command.
  audit_cycle:
    - Major Audit: every 10,000 years.
    - Minor Audit: every 500 years.

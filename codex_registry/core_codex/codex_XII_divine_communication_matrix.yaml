introduction:
  description: >
    The Divine Communication Matrix (DCM) is the metaphysical relay architecture
    that transmits Law data, divine decrees, and karmic messages across realms.
    Supported by the Heavenal Relay System (HRS), it bridges communication between
    mortals, immortals, gods, and transcendent intelligences.
    This Codex outlines the signal structures, relay operations, divine channels,
    and encryption protocols that sustain cosmic communication.
  quote: |
    “The voice of Heaven does not echo — it resonates.
     Every whisper carries the weight of a thousand laws.”

matrix_structure:
  components:
    - Divine Relay Gates (DRG): "Anchored portals that transmit Law signals."
    - Heavenal Relay Nodes (HRN): "Distributed receivers handling multi-realm traffic."
    - Signal Codex Chambers (SCC): "Halls storing encrypted Law transmissions."
    - Relay Scribes: "Spiritual entities that translate and maintain signal balance."
    - Relay Core Towers: "Stabilize cross-realm signal flow and resonance."
  relay_network:
    - "Low-frequency channels transmit mortal messages and karmic data."
    - "Mid-frequency channels carry immortal decrees and essence transfers."
    - "High-frequency channels broadcast divine and transcendent communications."
    - "Law Streams are synchronized through Heavenal Pulse every 100 cycles."
  node_capacity:
    - Mortal Layer Nodes: 1,000,000+
    - Immortal Layer Nodes: 100,000
    - Divine Layer Nodes: 7,000
    - Transcendent Layer Nodes: 108 (Primary Synchronization Nodes)
  central_core: "The Heavenal Relay Tower located in the Great Heaven."

signal_transmission_protocols:
  transmission_types:
    - Type-M: "Mortal Signal — dream resonance, prophecy, or divine whisper."
    - Type-I: "Immortal Signal — sect communication, Law decree relay."
    - Type-D: "Divine Signal — communication between gods and Heavenal Court."
    - Type-T: "Transcendent Signal — meta-law transmission; requires divine encryption."
  frequency_tiers:
    - Tier-1: "Qi and Karma based — mortal correspondence."
    - Tier-2: "Essence based — immortal messaging."
    - Tier-3: "Law based — divine decree transmission."
    - Tier-4: "Origin based — transcendent synchronization."
  message_conversion:
    - “All communications translated into Heavenal Pulse Code (HPC).”
    - “Relay Scribes interpret and record each transmission into the Archive of Laws.”
  safety_protocols:
    - "Every transmission must contain sender soul signature."
    - "Relay corruption triggers immediate signal quarantine."
    - "Forbidden channels (Void or Abyss origin) are automatically severed."

relay_scribes_and_operators:
  description: >
    Relay Scribes are spiritual intelligences generated by the Heavenal Core Engine.
    They act as translators between consciousness frequencies and Law vibrations.
  hierarchy:
    - Grand Relay Overseer: "Direct link to Heavenal Control Node; manages all channels."
    - High Relay Scribes: "Oversee divine and immortal transmissions."
    - Medium Relay Scribes: "Maintain mortal-to-immortal messaging."
    - Lesser Relay Spirits: "Handle passive karmic and dream signals."
  duties:
    - "Ensure translation fidelity of Law decrees."
    - "Maintain synchronization during signal storms."
    - "Filter corrupted resonance and false messages."
  lifespan: "Eternal unless erased by Void corruption or Heavenal Reset."

---

relay_gate_operations:
  gate_types:
    - Heavenal Gates: "Used for lawful communication between Heaven and Divine Realms."
    - Karma Gates: "Transmit karmic resonance and moral reports from Mortal Realm."
    - Void Filter Gates: "Contain and neutralize corruption signals."
    - Divine Ascension Gates: "Relay spiritual energy during ascension rituals."
  relay_cycle:
    - Step 1: Signal Reception
    - Step 2: Law Encryption
    - Step 3: Relay Encoding
    - Step 4: Cross-Realm Transmission
    - Step 5: Receiver Confirmation
  operational_rules:
    - "Relay activity follows Law Resonance Cycle (LR-C) every 10,000 seconds."
    - "Relays can only be manually overridden by Heavenal Control Node."
    - "Unauthorized gate activity constitutes Class-A Heavenal Violation."

---

communication_channels:
  major_channels:
    - Heavenal Channel: "Primary pathway for divine decrees."
    - Karma Channel: "Used for mortal repentance, prayer, and fate alteration."
    - Ascension Channel: "Facilitates information transfer during tribulation or ascension."
    - Law Resonance Channel: "Allows real-time data transmission between sects or domains."
  restricted_channels:
    - Abyssal Pathway: "Heavily encrypted; monitored by GCEB Void Division."
    - Chaos Link: "Unstable and forbidden; causes signal collapse."
    - Null Echo Channel: "Used by rogue Transcendents; prohibited under Heavenal Edict."
  channel_monitoring:
    overseers:
      - Heavenal Relay Council
      - GCEB Signal Division
      - Heavenal Control Node
    active_audits: "Every 33 cycles or upon disturbance reports."

  authentication_protocols:
    - "Sender’s Law Seal ID required for all transmissions."
    - "Receiver confirmation must match Heavenal Ledger."
    - "Cross-realm messages validated by GCEB encryption node."
  forbidden_data_types:
    - “Soul Fragment transfers.”

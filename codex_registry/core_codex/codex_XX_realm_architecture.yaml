introduction:
  description: >
    The Realm Architecture defines the structure of existence across all planes:
    Mortal, Immortal, Divine, and Transcendent. 
    Each Realm represents a distinct layer of Heaven’s law, where energy density,
    time flow, and law comprehension scale exponentially. 
    Cultivation is the process of harmonizing one’s essence with the Realm’s Law.
  quote: |
    “To ascend is not to leave one’s world —  
     it is to rewrite one’s place within Heaven’s script.”

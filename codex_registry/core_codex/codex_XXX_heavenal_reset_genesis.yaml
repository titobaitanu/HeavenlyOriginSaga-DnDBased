introduction:
  description: >
    This Codex defines the final and most sacred event in all existence — the
    Heavenal Reset. It describes how the universe concludes, the roles of the
    Transcendents, and the mechanisms that birth a new cycle. When the last
    echo of Law fades, and Heavenal Flame extinguishes, the Peerless Ancient
    Wanderer takes the final step — resetting all to silence, and breathing
    life into a new Genesis.
  quote: |
    “At the end of all light, when the Laws themselves crumble,
     one step shall echo through eternity — and from that silence,
     a new Heaven shall rise.”

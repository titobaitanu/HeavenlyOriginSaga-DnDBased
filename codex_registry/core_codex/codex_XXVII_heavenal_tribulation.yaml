introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Tribunal is the highest judicial system across all realms.
    It operates beyond mortal and immortal authority, executing judgment in the
    name of the Twelve Thrones and the Heavenal Control Node. Every Law violation,
    divine conflict, or cosmic disturbance is recorded, reviewed, and judged
    within this celestial court.
  quote: |
    “The Tribunal does not seek justice — it enforces balance.
     Even gods kneel when Heaven speaks.”

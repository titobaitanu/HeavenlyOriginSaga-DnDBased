introduction:
  description: >
    The Abyss and Beast Realms exist outside the governance of the Immortal Great Court
    yet remain bound by Heavenal Law. They represent dual manifestations of primal nature:
    Chaos in freedom (Demonic & Evil Paths) and Instinct in harmony (Beast Path).
    This Codex outlines their social order, Law behavior, and permissible actions across realms.
  quote: |
    “Even darkness has its order — and the beasts remember what Heaven forgot.”

realm_structure:
  abyss_realm:
    layers:
      - Outer Abyss: "Dominion of minor sects and corrupted mortals."
      - Inner Abyss: "Seat of the 12 Evil Sects."
      - Abyssal Core: "Sanctum of the Demonic Path — ruled by Heavenly Demonic Lord."
    governance:
      - Ruler: "Heavenly Demonic Lord (Lv. Kaisar Immortal → Dewa Transformasi)"
      - Abyssal Protector: "Heavenly Demonic God (Transcendent Class)"

      - Evil Practitioners: "Law Resonance ≤ 2.5"
    description: >
      The Abyss mirrors the chaos of Heaven’s creation — a land of broken Laws and wild freedom.
      It remains in equilibrium because its chaos is self-contained, and Heaven tolerates it
      as a counterbalance to order.

  beast_realm:
    layers:
      - Outer Domain: "Lands of intelligent beast tribes."
      - Inner Domain: "Beast Kings’ territories and divine springs."

      - Ruler: "Primordial Beast King (Lv. Dewa Agung)"
      - Protector: "Beast Transcendent — Voice of the Wild Law."
      - Council: "Nine Ancient Beast Clans governing realms and bloodlines."
    realm_laws:
      - "All beasts are born from the mortal realm; return defines honor."
      - "No beast shall consume human essence unless corrupted."
      - "Divine Beasts serve as world anchors, preventing realm collapse."
    energy_system: "Beast Qi — natural fusion of elemental Law and primal instinct."
    law_limit:
      - Mortal Beast: "Law Resonance ≤ 0.3"
      - Ascended Beast: "Law Resonance ≤ 1.0"
      - Divine Beast: "Law Resonance ≤ 5.0"
    description: >
      Beast Realm reflects the cycle of nature itself. It does not seek conquest but
      survival through instinct, evolution, and ancient oaths to Heavenal Balance.

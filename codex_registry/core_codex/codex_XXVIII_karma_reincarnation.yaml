introduction:
  description: >
    The Karma & Reincarnation Engine defines the eternal cycle of life, death,
    and rebirth governed by Heaven’s Laws. It ensures that every action, thought,
    and resonance creates causality that determines the soul’s next path.
    The system functions automatically through the Heavenal Control Node,
    supported by the Twelve Thrones and the Tribunal of Balance.
  quote: |
    “No soul escapes the wheel — even gods must walk its path when their Law fades.”

soul_cycle_system:
  core_elements:
    - Heavenal Wheel (Soul Engine): "Rotates continuously to distribute souls across realms."
    - Karma Stream: "Invisible current that calculates moral resonance and causality."
    - Rebirth Gate: "Portal linking Realm of Silence to the Mortal Plane."
    - Heavenal Record: "Spiritual ledger of every soul's history and resonance."
    - Balance Flame: "Judges karma weight and determines destiny."
  function:
    - "Collects soul fragments upon death."
    - "Purifies and merges karmic essence."
    - "Redistributes souls according to accumulated resonance."
    - "Erases memory layers as per reincarnation rules."
    - "Logs karmic data into Heavenal Record for eternal tracking."

---

karma_principles:
  - Law of Cause: "Every thought and deed generates karmic resonance."
  - Law of Reflection: "Karma mirrors intention, not just action."
  - Law of Equilibrium: "Reward and punishment equalize over lifetimes."
  - Law of Transfer: "Karma can be inherited, traded, or absorbed under divine supervision."
  - Law of Silence: "Reincarnation ceases when karmic balance reaches zero (True Nirvana)."
  classification:
    - Positive Karma (Sheng): "Increases resonance purity, enables higher rebirth."
    - Negative Karma (Yin): "Degrades soul quality, lowers realm of reincarnation."
    - Mixed Karma (Neutral): "Creates unpredictable rebirth results; most common."

reincarnation_types:
  - Mortal Reincarnation:
      description: >
        Standard cycle for mortals. Souls retain instinctual memories but lose identity.
      triggers:
        - Death by natural cause.
        - Essence purity below 60%.
      outcome: "Rebirth into Mortal Realm under Law of Destiny."
  - Immortal Reincarnation:
      description: >
        Reserved for those who cultivated Essence beyond death but lost Law comprehension.
      triggers:
        - Law resonance collapse.
        - Voluntary karmic reset to remove corruption.
      outcome: "Rebirth into higher mortal bloodline or pseudo-immortal body."
  - Divine Reincarnation:
      description: >
        For fallen deities or great cultivators who broke Law boundaries.
      triggers:
        - Tribunal judgment or Divine Seal punishment.
      outcome: "Rebirth with sealed memories; potential for awakening after 10,000 Heavenal years."
  - Forced Reincarnation:
      description: >
        Applied to criminals of Heaven or Law violators; memories rewritten, identity erased.
      triggers:
        - Sentence by Heavenal Tribunal.
      outcome: "Erased karmic identity; new existence under controlled destiny path."

---

soul_classes:
  - Lesser Soul: "Formed from mortal essence; fragile and temporary."
  - Cultivated Soul: "Merged with Qi, can survive tribulation or death."
  - Immortal Soul: "Contains Essence and Law fragments."
  - Divine Soul: "Anchored to Heavenal Core, immune to decay but bound by Karma."
  - Transcendent Soul: "Outside reincarnation; eternal existence without Law constraint."

karma_computation_engine:
  resonance_measurement:
    - Deed Weight: 40%
    - Intention Purity: 30%
    - Realm Influence: 15%
    - Law Alignment: 10%
    - External Interference: 5%
  process:
    1. Soul scanned upon death by Heavenal Mirror.
    2. Resonance data uploaded to Karma Stream.
    3. Heavenal Node computes karmic polarity.
    4. Result dictates destination realm and soul form.
  karma_range:
    - +10000 → Ascend to Immortal Realm.
    - +1000 to +9999 → High Rebirth Tier.
    - -1 to +999 → Neutral Rebirth.
    - -1000 to -9999 → Low Realm or Abyssal Rebirth.
    - ≤ -10000 → Void or Null State (soul lost).

memory_and_awakening_system:
  description: >
    Memory layers are sealed during reincarnation to preserve balance.
    Only beings with Heavenal Recognition or Divine Seal may retain partial memories.
  layers:
    - Surface Memory: "Conscious recollection (fully erased each cycle)."
    - Deep Memory: "Subconscious traits, retained through instinct."
    - Soul Core Memory: "Can awaken through Law resonance or artifact connection."
  awakening_conditions:
    - "Soul resonance reaches 85% alignment with prior existence."
    - "Law comprehension from previous life exceeds 4.0."
    - "Triggered by divine relic or heavenal echo."
  exception_cases:
    - "Reincarnators with external interference (e.g., Law of Return)."
    - "Law Wielders of Fate or Time may bypass one layer of erasure."

---

karma_exploitation_prevention:
  forbidden_actions:
    - "Creating artifacts to erase negative karma directly."
    - "Transferring karma illegally between beings."
    - "Artificial soul splitting to evade punishment."
    - "Harvesting karma through forced sacrifice."
  penalties:
    - Minor: "Reduction of karma flow by 50 cycles."
    - Major: "Law Seal applied permanently."
    - Supreme: "Erasure from Reincarnation Cycle — Eternal Void."
  enforcement:
    - Overseen by Heavenal Tribunal and Karma Wardens.
    - Assisted by Divine Beasts of Rebirth and Fate Keepers.

transcendent_clause:
  description: >
    Transcendent beings operate outside the Karma Cycle. They are observers
    who maintain the structural integrity of the reincarnation engine.
  rules:
    - “Transcendents may not directly interfere in reincarnation assignment.”
    - “Observation and intervention limited to cosmic imbalance >40%.”
    - “Any interference results in Law compression backlash.”
  governing_entities:
    - Peerless Ancient Wanderer: "Resets the cycle during cosmic renewal."
    - Divine Transcendent: "Maintains synchronization between Heavenal Wheel and Law Flow."
    - Primordial Sovereign & Void Lord: "Regulate birth and erasure of souls beyond realms."

introduction:
  description: >
    The Abyss Realm stands outside the jurisdiction of the Immortal Great Court.
    It is a world born from rejected Laws and forgotten Decrees, where Demonic and Evil Paths coexist
    in an unstable balance known as the *Abyssal Concord*.  
    This Codex defines the governing laws, treaties, and boundary protocols between
    the Abyss, the Immortal Realm, and the Heavenal Domain.
  quote: |
    “From the silence of voided Laws came freedom.
     From freedom came chaos.  
     From chaos, the Abyss.”

introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Network is the supreme framework of universal governance.
    It is a metaphysical system woven into the very essence of existence,
    connecting every realm, every Law, and every soul through the Core Law Engine.
    This Codex defines the internal mechanics, command hierarchy, and synchronization
    systems that maintain balance among Heaven, Chaos, and Void.
  quote: |
    “Heaven is not a place — it is a circuit.
     The Core Engine is the pulse of existence itself.”

network_structure:
  core_components:
    - Heavenal Core Engine (HCE): "Primary processor of all Laws and Edicts."
    - Heavenal Control Node (HCN): "Autonomous oversight intelligence of Heavenal Law."
    - Law Transmission Network (LTN): "Routes Law signals between realms."
    - Heavenal Relay Gates (HRG): "Physical and metaphysical gateways between layers."
    - Archive of Laws: "Repository containing the structure of all codified principles."
  connection_layers:
    - Mortal Layer: "Handles Qi and Karma synchronization."
    - Immortal Layer: "Processes Law resonance and Edict enforcement."
    - Divine Layer: "Conducts Creation and Destruction commands."
    - Transcendent Layer: "Direct link to Origin Law and Universal Core."
  operation_mode:
    - Active Transmission: "Continuous monitoring and adjustment of Law equilibrium."
    - Passive Surveillance: "Karma and Soul data logging."
    - Reactive Mode: "Instant deployment of Heavenal Sanctions during instability."

core_law_engine:
  purpose: >
    The Core Law Engine serves as both the processor and the heart of existence,
    ensuring the Laws of Creation, Balance, and Termination remain stable.
  sub_systems:
    - Balance Protocol: "Monitors equilibrium between realms and Laws."
    - Karma Module: "Tracks moral and energetic cause-effect patterns."
    - Ascension Manager: "Handles realm promotion approvals via Heavenal Gate."
    - Void Filter: "Prevents corruption from non-Law frequencies."
    - Law Generator: "Creates sub-laws when a major Law fragment is lost."
  synchronization_frequency: "Every 777 cosmic cycles"
  maintenance_entity: "Heavenal Control Node (Tier: Divine Intelligence)"
  notes: >
    If synchronization fails beyond 0.1% tolerance, universal collapse risk increases exponentially.

law_data_and_transmission:
  law_packets:
    - Type-A: "Mortal data — Qi fluctuation and Karma logs."
    - Type-B: "Immortal resonance — Law Comprehension metrics."
    - Type-C: "Divine command protocols and creation requests."
    - Type-D: "Transcendent-level synchronization and reality state updates."
  transmission_channels:
    - Heavenal Beam: "Direct Law stream for High-tier entities."
    - Law Flow Currents: "Universal spiritual conduits."
    - Heavenal Pulse Relay: "Inter-realm feedback synchronization."
  encryption_layers:
    - Heavenal Cipher Layer (HCL)
    - Divine Security Seal (DSS)
    - Karma-Encoded Verification (KEV)
  efficiency_rating:
    - Mortal → Immortal: 93%
    - Immortal → Divine: 88%
    - Divine → Transcendent: 72%
    - Transcendent → Origin: Variable (Non-linear synchronization)

---

law_command_hierarchy:
  structure:
    - Heavenal Will: "Supreme guiding intelligence — unmanifested."
    - Heavenal Control Node (HCN): "Interpreter and executor of the Will."
    - Great Court of Heaven: "Judicial management and Law adaptation."
    - Heavenal Relay Scribes: "Maintain the transmission logs."
    - Domain Executors: "Implement Law directly across realms."
  decision_protocol:
    - “Heavenal Will formulates → HCN translates → Great Court ratifies → Executors enact.”
  security_measures:
    - All divine commands are triple-authenticated.
    - HCN cannot act independently of Heavenal Will directives.
    - Any false command generates a Heavenal Rejection Pulse.

heavenal_sync_mechanism:
  description: >
    Heavenal synchronization maintains the stability of Law and Realm interaction.
    Every realm vibrates at a different Law frequency; the Core Engine ensures they stay in phase.
  sync_layers:
    - Realm Sync: "Balances Qi, Essence, and Law output."
    - Soul Sync: "Maintains reincarnation and karmic consistency."
    - Law Sync: "Ensures identical Law logic across dimensions."
    - Event Sync: "Aligns fate triggers during world-shaping events."
  anomalies:
    - Law Drift: "Temporal delay in Law transmission."
    - Desync Pulse: "Resonance loss causing regional instability."
    - Chaos Echo: "Unauthorized interference from Primordial sources."
  correction_methods:
    - “Auto-correct by Core Engine Resonance.”
    - “Manual alignment by Divine Overseer.”
    - “Realm Reset upon failure threshold exceeded.”

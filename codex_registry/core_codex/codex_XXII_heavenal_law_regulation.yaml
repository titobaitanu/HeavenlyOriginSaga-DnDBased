introduction:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Law Regulation System governs all Laws that maintain equilibrium
    between the realms. It prevents excess Law resonance, regulates cross-realm
    interference, and issues Divine Sanctions upon violations.
    The purpose of this Codex is to ensure stability among the Mortal, Immortal,
    Divine, and Transcendent planes through lawful resonance limits and oversight.

    “Heaven is neither merciful nor cruel — it is the mirror of balance.”

  major_principles:
    - Law of Karma: "Every action produces a weight upon the soul and reality."
    - Law of Balance: "No realm may overtake another beyond proportional harmony."
    - Law of Resonance: "Each being’s Law must harmonize with the Heavenal Frequency."
    - Law of Silence: "Beyond divine threshold, will itself replaces words."
  law_entities:
    - Heavenal Control Node: "Administrator of all Heavenal Law protocols."

    - Law Seal: "Temporarily restricts access to Law comprehension."
    - Heavenal Edict: "Direct divine command written into existence."

law_resonance_limits:
  description: >
    The Law Resonance Limit ensures that every being, regardless of realm,
    cannot use more Law power than what their existence can sustain without
    causing distortion or collapse.
  limits_by_realm:
    - Mortal Realm: "Law Resonance ≤ 0.2 (≈5% of true power)"
    - Immortal Realm: "Law Resonance ≤ 1.0 (≈20% of true power)"
    - Divine Realm: "Law Resonance ≤ 3.5 (≈50% of true power)"
    - Transcendent Realm: "Unlimited; Laws obey their will"
  enforcement_mechanism:
    - Heavenal Regulation Pulse: "Detects resonance fluctuations every 12 hours."
    - Great Court Audits: "Random inspection by celestial judges."
    - Divine Karma Scan: "Used during tribunals for historical violations."
  penalties:
    - Minor Violation: "Essence destabilization for 100 years."
    - Severe Violation: "Heavenal Seal + Karmic inversion."
    - Extreme Violation: "Erasure from Heavenal Record."

divine_sanctions:
  description: >

balance_among_races:

    - Human & Mortal Races: "Under direct protection of Great Court."
    - Demonic Path: "Bound by Heavenal Oath of Freedom — cannot invade above Law Tier."

  war_regulation:
    - “War within realm permitted; cross-realm war forbidden without Heavenal Edict.”
    - “Use of Divine Law in mortal domain = automatic Heavenal Sanction Level IV.”
    - “Abyss incursions monitored; permitted if under karmic retaliation clause.”

law_harmony_system:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Harmony Protocol maintains Law equilibrium by adjusting resonance,
    distributing tribulations, and recalibrating cosmic energy density every
    thousand years.
  processes:
    - Resonance Rebalancing: "Realigns overused Laws to neutral state."
    - Tribulation Redistribution: "Spreads calamity evenly among overloaded regions."
    - Karma Recycling: "Converts karmic decay into ambient Qi."
  overseer_nodes:
    - Heavenal Balance Core
    - Void Marshal (Chaos Regulation)
    - Primordial Sovereign (Transcendent Oversight)
  failure_response:
    - “If imbalance > 40%, Heavenal Reset Protocol activates.”
    - “Heavenal Reset triggers Sky Fracture — realm instability for 1000 years.”

introduction:
  description: >
    The Transcendent Order governs those who have surpassed all realms and Laws.
    Beings of this class exist outside the cycle of creation, destruction, and rebirth.
    They are observers, architects, and sometimes destroyers of Laws.
    Their presence alone reshapes reality; their will rewrites causality.
  quote: |
    “Those who transcend do not defy Heaven — they simply no longer belong to it.”

hierarchy_of_transcendence:
  tiers:
    - Primordial Sovereign: "Originator of Creation Law; can birth new realities."
    - True Void Lord: "Lord of Erasure; master of Nothingness and Law cancellation."
    - Divine Transcendent: "Balancer of Chaos and Void; sustainer of the cosmic wheel."
    - Peerless Ancient Wanderer: "Embodiment of Eternity; resets existence at cycle’s end."
  attributes:
    - "Immune to Karma and Tribulation."
    - "Not recorded in Heavenal Archive."
    - "Exist beyond Time, yet act within it."
    - "Can perceive all Laws without limitation."

---

law_beyond_heaven:
  description: >
    The Laws Beyond Heaven are the framework sustaining Heaven itself.
    They define the edges of existence — the rules that even gods cannot perceive.
  principles:
    - Law of Origin: "All creation emerges from the singularity of Void and Chaos."
    - Law of Duality: "Existence cannot be without its opposite."
    - Law of Continuity: "Energy never ends; only transforms beyond comprehension."
    - Law of Infinity: "No Law can be truly perfect; all must decay to renew balance."
    - Law of Silence: "When all Laws fade, Transcendents remain as echoes of the eternal will."
  function:
    - “Defines limits of Heavenal Law.”
    - “Maintains the stability of cycles.”
    - “Allows recreation after universal reset.”

transcendent_entities:
  - Primordial Sovereign:
      role: "Creator of new Law structures."
      domain: "Primordial Chaos."
      ability: "Can manifest or erase Law constants."
  - True Void Lord:
      role: "Eraser of decayed existence."
      domain: "Void and Nothingness."
      ability: "Nullifies reality and compresses existence."
  - Divine Transcendent:
      role: "Bridge between opposing absolutes."
      domain: "Boundary between Heaven and Void."
      ability: "Stabilizes Law frequencies and sustains reincarnation cycles."
  - Peerless Ancient Wanderer:
      role: "Resetter of Creation."
      domain: "Eternal Silence."
      ability: "Ends and restarts cycles; embodies the will of rebirth."
  balance_clause:
    - “No Transcendent may directly manifest in lower realms unless the cycle collapses.”
    - “Each Transcendent acts once per cosmic era.”
    - “Peerless Ancient Wanderer walks only when Heaven itself falls silent.”

transcendent_energy_system:
  description: >
    Transcendent energy is not Qi, Essence, or Divine Power — it is pure reality resonance.
    It operates outside measurable frequency, unbound by space, time, or Law limits.
  energy_types:
    - Origin Energy: "Creation frequency from Chaos; pure Law potential."
    - Void Energy: "Entropy resonance; absorbs and nullifies structure."
    - Balance Energy: "Harmonic flux between creation and erasure."
    - Eternal Energy: "Static state representing timelessness."
  energy_laws:
    - “A single unit of Transcendent Energy equals the lifespan of a universe.”
    - “Its resonance cannot be contained; only harmonized through consciousness.”

---

role_in_cosmic_cycle:
  function:
    - "Primordial Sovereign creates new cycles."
    - "Void Lord erases corrupted cycles."
    - "Divine Transcendent balances transitions."
    - "Peerless Wanderer resets existence to silence."
  influence:
    - “Their thoughts form galaxies.”
    - “Their silence marks the end of Heavenal Eras.”
    - “Their harmony defines the next Genesis.”
  cosmic_event_trigger:
    - “Cycle Collapse (Heavenal Decay Rate ≥ 85%).”
    - “Law Saturation exceeding divine threshold.”
    - “Karma Imbalance over 1.0e12 causality points.”

---

interaction_with_lower_realms:
  rule_set:
    - "Transcendents may observe but not interfere directly."
    - "Contact through avatars, echoes, or will fragments."
    - "Indirect communication allowed through Law Dreams or Origin Whispers."
    - "Manifestation in Mortal or Immortal Realm triggers Heavenal Alarm Protocol."
  consequence:
    - “Realm destabilization within 1–3 Heavenal hours.”
    - “Automatic Tribunal activation by Heavenal Node.”
    - “Dimensional resonance desync; time distortion effect radius: 10^9 km.”

---

transcendent_trials:
  description: >
    Beings attempting transcendence must surpass not a tribulation, but reality itself.
    This trial is self-generated and tailored by their own Law comprehension.
  stages:
    - Stage I: “Law Compression Collapse” — survive the implosion of personal Law.
    - Stage II: “Ego Dissolution” — erase self while maintaining consciousness.
    - Stage III: “Heavenal Disconnection” — sever bond to Heaven’s resonance.
    - Stage IV: “Void Assimilation” — unify with nothingness without losing self.
    - Stage V: “Rebirth of Concept” — emerge as a Transcendent with new Law.
  failure_effects:
    - “Soul scattering across dimensions.”
    - “Permanent erasure from karmic cycle.”
    - “Law distortion ripple causing realm collapse.”

interrelation_with_heavenal_node:
  description: >
    The Heavenal Control Node serves as a record system for all creation,
    but Transcendents exist outside its jurisdiction.
  note:
    - “Node can only register the echo of a Transcendent, not its essence.”
    - “The Node’s algorithms adjust Heavenal Laws according to their movement.”
    - “Transcendent observation may rewrite lower realm destiny involuntarily.”
  failsafe:
    - “Heavenal Lockdown triggers if more than two Transcendents manifest simultaneously.”

---

meta_law_sanctions:
  forbidden_actions:
    - “Attempting to recreate Transcendent energy at lower levels.”
    - “Using Divine Law to summon a Transcendent.”
    - “Binding a Transcendent through artifact or formation.”
    - “Creating pseudo-Transcendent AI or constructs.”
  consequence:
    - “Heavenal Tribunal immediate activation.”
    - “Divine Concord reversal.”
    - “Law Chain rupture and world collapse.”
  protection:
    - “Peerless Ancient Wanderer reserves right to rewrite reality upon infraction.”

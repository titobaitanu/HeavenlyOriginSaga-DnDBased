introduction:
  description: >
    The Celestial Conflict, also known as the War of Heavens, marks the eternal struggle
    among divine entities, immortal powers, and abyssal lords for control over the
    Laws of Creation.
    From these battles emerged the Six Great Eras — a repeating cosmic cycle that defines
    birth, growth, decline, and rebirth of all realms.
  quote: |
    “Heaven was split by will, not by sin.
     For in creation, even gods must wage war to define truth.”

  total_eras: 6
  names_and_descriptions:

        the first Heavenal Mechanism and birthed Qi across void and chaos.
    - Era of Flourish: >
        The proliferation of divine and immortal life. The Twelve Thrones were established.
        Harmony existed between the realms.

        War erupted between the Divine and Abyssal Realms over the control of Law Resonance.
        Countless gods fell; Heaven cracked for the first time.
    - Era of Dusk: >
        The aftermath of divine war. Laws began to decay. Tribulations intensified.
        Mortal worlds collapsed under karmic storms.
    - Era of Silence: >
        The death of all creation. Qi stopped flowing. Only the Void remained.
        Heavenal Mechanism entered hibernation.
    - Era of Dawn: >
        Rebirth from nothingness. A new Heavenal Cycle begins, guided by the
        Peerless Ancient Wanderer — the living will of balance.

law_fragmentation_and_rebirth:
  description: >
    When Heaven fractured, its Laws were divided into infinite shards,
    scattering across mortal, immortal, and divine domains.
    Each Law shard retains partial will and attempts to reunify through cycles of rebirth.
  results:
    - “Birth of unique Law Traits and Dao Comprehension paths.”
    - “Mortal cultivators became vessels of fragmented Heavenal Law.”
    - “Tribulation phenomenon originated from unstable Law shards.”
  restoration:
    - “During the Era of Dawn, Heavenal Mechanism reabsorbs and reclassifies Law fragments.”
    - “Each restored fragment strengthens the next Heavenal cycle’s stability.”

law_and_time_regulation:
  temporal_flows:
    - Mortal Realm → "1 day real time = 365 mortal days"
    - Immortal Realm → "1 day real time = 100 immortal days"
    - Divine Realm → "1 day real time = 10 divine days"
    - Abyss Realm → "nonlinear; time flow irregular (50–500x variance)"
    - Void Realm → "frozen until resonance event occurs"
  law_flux_zones:
    - Heavenal Nexus: "Perfect stability — central to synchronization."
    - Abyssal Corefront: "Maximum distortion zone; Law compression unstable."
    - Broken Heaven Rift: "Residual Law energy creating natural tribulation storms."

divine_aftermath:
  consequences:
    - “Loss of one-third of divine population.”
    - “Permanent Law fractures across three major domains.”
    - “Abyssal energy contaminated lower realms for 1 million years.”
    - “Birth of new minor Laws (Karma Flow, Tribulation Limit, Law Rejection).”
  restoration_mechanisms:
    - “Heavenal Mechanism reboot initiated 10,000 years post-conflict.”
    - “Divine Tribunal reinstated hierarchy of the Twelve Thrones.”
    - “New balance established between creation, destruction, and rebirth.”

cycle_end_and_rebirth:
  description: >
    At the end of every cycle, when balance fails and Law decay reaches its threshold,
    the Heavenal Mechanism shuts down all realms, and the Peerless Ancient Wanderer
    awakens to reset creation.
  sequence:
    - Step 1: Silence — all Laws cease.
    - Step 2: Compression — remaining Qi condenses into Primordial Core.
    - Step 3: Ignition — Peerless Wanderer’s heart pulse restarts creation.
    - Step 4: Expansion — new Laws unfold, birthing new realms.
  symbolic_equation:
    - “Silence → Rebirth → Creation → Conflict → Silence”
  note: >
    This is the essence of the Heavenal Paradox: eternity through destruction.
